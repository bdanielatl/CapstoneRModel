I know there are developments being proposed in Chesterfield Valley, which may eventually point toward the need for a new fire station. We're developing a master plan for the district and doing a needs assessment. Also important is maintaining and improving our ISO rating, which determines fire insurance rates for residents and businesses.

“The curveball does curve, but the curve has been measured and shown to be gradual,” Shapiro said on the American University website. “It’s always going to follow a parabolic path.

"People are scared of the wrath of Rahm," said one alderman, who asked to remain anonymous. "He carries a big stick. He hasn't whacked anybody with it yet, but" aldermen are afraid that he might.
Hey, Tony: You've mentioned Colt McCoy's arm strength as a possible concern. I am starting to see that defenses, since they're not afraid of getting beat over the top, are cheating up and jamming the Cleveland running game and intermediate passing routes. Can the Browns scheme around this or at some point do you need a QB with the arm strength to make a D pay for cheating up on him? One more question. I know McCoy is effective on the move, but at some point, don't you have to make throws from the pocket so that you're not always playing on half a football field? That seems to be a limitation, too (but I know the shaky O-line play has been part of this). -- Jeff Biletnikoff, Erie, Pa.
"It will probably end up in a closet or rolling down a slide in the backyard, the girls playing with it," he said Wednesday without a trace of a grin.
Laid-off workers may keep their money in their ex-employer's 401(k) plan or roll it over into an individual retirement account, or IRA, under government rules. Advisers say that, if the 401(k) is a good plan, with low expenses and solidly performing funds, you should consider standing pat to take advantage of the resources such plans offer, such as investment-ratings data and other information, said Jason Chepenik, managing partner of Chepenik Financial, an Orlando financial-planning firm. Older workers should definitely avoid rolling over 401(k) funds into an IRA, he said, because early withdrawals from an IRA are always subject to the 10 percent government penalty, even if the laid-off employee is age 55 to 59 1/2.

At least 36 swim coaches and officials were disciplined by USA Swimming between 2000 and 2010 for sexual misconduct. American figure skating and track and field have also had coaching sex scandals. Former Canadian junior hockey coach Graham James, once named Man of the Year by The Hockey News, pleaded guilty to 350 charges of sexual abuse in 1997 after former NHL player Sheldon Kennedy and an unnamed player said they were sexually abused by James. In recent years, another former NHL star, Theo Fleury, came forward and said he was also abused by James.

Members of both political parties, including Cardin, say that over-classification is a problem in Washington. The 9/11 Commission named it as contributing to the government's inability to prevent the 2001 attacks, suggesting that excess classification made it more difficult for government agencies to share vital intelligence.

Perhaps the county merely wants to use same-sex marriage benefits as a bargaining chip in contract negotiations with the police union. If so, that's a strategy officials may want to reconsider. Better for Mr. Kamenetz to stand up now and make it clear to all county workers (and not just police officers) that Baltimore County does not deny health benefits that are rightfully due.

Faisal Alatrash, an engineer, had been with the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority for almost 20 years when he was caught shaking down contractors. RTA general manager Joe Calabrese said he was stunned by the revelation, which prompted the authority to establish better internal controls for dealing with contracts.

SOPA would establish a system for taking down websites that the Justice Department determines to be engaged in copyright infringement, says the nonpartisan Open Congress. Copyright owners would be able to start legal action against any site they believe has “only limited purpose or use other than infringement.” In those cases, the government could demand that search engines, social networking sites and domain name services block access to the targeted site.
The long-term plan, which will unfold over a 10-year period, also calls for a 32-acre park, a 100,000-square-foot children’s hospital and a 200-bed subacute-care facility.

For one, net migration from Mexico to the United States has come to a standstill as the number of people trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border has fallen off and many immigrants have opted to return to their countries amid this country's ongoing economic woes. Moreover, while immigration reform and deportation rules are still very pertinent issues, the battles are being fought more in courtrooms and legislative halls than in the streets.

Kelly recruited quarterback Ryan Katz, now at Oregon State, once upon a time. He lost that bid, too. And don't think for a moment that the Ducks coach wasn't thinking about that as the Civil War approached.

I am only sorry the senator didn't list reducing the $325 million to be spent on military bands next year.

That's one instance where House authorizers made a good choice.

But in the larger picture, if you're a tourist visiting California's Central Coast, you'd be crazy to ignore this place. Some of the reasons for the aquarium's popularity are as obvious as a dozen orange jellyfish hovering before a vivid blue background. Others become clearer with a glimpse behind the scenes. It takes an array of people and hardware to keep the place running, including 420 workers and about 1,250 active volunteers. The water comes straight from the bay, about 2,000 gallons a minute, sucked in through one of two 16-inch intake pipes, then filtered and piped throughout the aquarium, mostly at the ambient temperature of the bay's water. This morning, it's 54 degrees.

Most of the action, where Besson is clearly more comfortable, comes as events unfold outside the compound where Suu Kyi is held — cinematographer Thierry Arbogast, a frequent Besson collaborator, does particularly good work there too.

Michael Drewniak, a spokesman for Christie, a Republican, declined comment. Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Bob Martin, who is fighting a polluting power plant in Pennsylvania near Warren County, has not taken a position on the EPA rule, spokesman Larry Ragonese said.
So far, the answer is "no." Political leaders don't lead. They take the path of least resistance, which has been to do little except to find scapegoats -- "the rich," "special interests," "liberals," "conservatives" -- that arouse their supporters' angriest antagonisms. It helps explain polarization. This is really what Washington does. It's a demoralizing commentary on the state of American democracy.

"It's a wonderful feeling. I'm just lucky I can give on a big level,'' said Wilsey, 61. She was in the news a few months ago when her stepson Sean Wilsey published a memoir that cast her as the wicked stepmother who poisoned his already troubled young life. She coolly dismisses it as a pack of lies. She'd rather talk about the museum to which she has dedicated a decade of her life.

Crawford and Felton surely benefited from Spurs coach Gregg Popovich's decision to rest All-Star point guard Tony Parker, who has been a force during the 11-game winning streak San Antonio came to Portland on.

If Gov. Ritter is going to use the Catholic faith as a launching platform to attack critics of Compañeros, perhaps he should look to his own public record.

Imposing such a dramatic cost on local truckers will cause many companies to lay off workers or join the thousands that closed their doors during the recession. Many businesses are pulling out of a deep hole, but rates are still depressed and the recovery is fragile.

The truth is, as much liberating fun as it can be to play with a few pals in a rock band, jazz combo or chamber music group — all of which I've done and still do — there's something uniquely transformative that can happen when a large group of disparate individuals yield their differences under the guidance of an inspired and knowledgeable leader to bring a singular vision to reality.

Only the EMS levy passed. Voters rejected the bond issue by a 3-to-1 margin.
When I am in someone else's house, I play by their rules. I respect where I am and don't take my shoes off and put my feet on their couch as I might do in my own home. I don't go walk around like I own the place, sit wherever or do whatever I please.
It's hard to imagine that bad blood has lasted 50 years, but maybe there's something to Sullinger's theory. Since that 1962 game, OSU and Cincinnati have faced each other just once, a 2006 matchup at the John Wooden Tradition in Indiana that OSU likely scheduled more to allow Indianapolis natives Greg Oden and Mike Conley to play back home than to rekindle a long-extinguished rivalry.

"Whose butt are we gonna kick today?" Bray-Marks calls out.
"Serving Up Style," in its second year, gave 10 Portland interior designers and architects an empty 12-by-12-foot dining room space to hatch their creations. The result ranged from Henry's Brown's "Celebrations!," which offered decadent treatment to a festive table shimmering in metallic silvers and pinks and surrounded by glitter snow, to Nicole Helene's "Into the Woods," a simple and spacious design that wall-hung the bark from local walnut and alder trees around a warmly lit wooden table where mason jars and basic cutlery sat.
That puts it in rare company. And right in there, in its own way, with Apple.
Weiss also serves as a moderator for the annual Michael Merritt Awards, a national award unique in its emphasis on excellence in both design and collaboration, that has been presented annually since 1994 to outstanding professional theatrical designers.

That's the case with the Village Bistro, where only one entree costs more than $20. But it's not for everyone. If you're pressed for time, on your way to something else and don't appreciate that everything is made from scratch, you may not appreciate this way of eating.

"If you look at 2008, the worst year on record, during the fourth week of April the river was flowing at about 250 (cubic feet per second). By the third week of May, it was down to about 80 cfs. So they dried up the redds," Spohn said. "They just didn't know. By the fourth week of June, the water was back up to 425 cfs. So then they blasted them. The same scenario happened in 2010, when we had 70 young-of-the-year per acre."

Revamping the restaurant, with the help of SMWM architects, has unleashed her creative juices. Keller fitted some of the best items on the Bizou menu, such as the tempura fried green beans ($6), into the new format. This dish is my litmus test by which all other frito misto is judged. The beans are coated in a puffy batter that crunches like corn flakes, releasing a gush of steam, yielding to tender green beans that are sweet and mild. She also kept the beef cheeks ($13) -- she was one of the first in the city to offer this once-overlooked cut of meat -- which are slowly braised to release the creamy gelatinous rivulets laced throughout the meat. She counters the richness with pungent horseradish and a peppery watercress salad.

Up front, two cupholders, an average-sized center console and storage bins in the front doors help contain loose stuff. Another discrete storage area is stashed behind the clean, modern floating center control panel. However, unlike in my C30, the bin isn't recessed enough to actually secure much.

She then invited my grandfather and uncle to enter the business with her.
The Ducks would love one. ASU? Not so sure. And so what we had on Saturday wasn't just a chance to see how much Oregon might miss star running back LaMichael James (out with dislocated elbow) or be able to function without quarterback Darron Thomas (knee injury), but so much more.

Now, two years later, analysts say they expect the Target decision to have little effect on Kindle sales.

Research by Joe Reedy of the Cincinnati Enquirer revealed some startling facts about the much-maligned Browns expansion tandem of Tim Couch and Kevin Johnson. They combined for the most receptions (57) and yards (859) of any rookie quarterback-receiver duo since 1991. Bengals rookies Andy Dalton and A.J. Green are on pace to eclipse the unofficial mark. Green/Dalton have 47 receptions for 777 yards with four games left. ... Listen to Houston coach Gary Kubiak and name the player he is speaking of: "He's a winner. You watch him play and he makes all of the throws, he buys himself time, he bails his team out of tough situations in terms of protections and those types of things. I just love the way he competes. When you're watching young players play at that level it's fun to watch." ... It's Dalton ...

In February 2009, Vanecko renewed his Illinois driver's license, saying he lived in an apartment in a high-rise at 1212 S. Michigan. That's also the first building that Vanecko's brother, Robert Vanecko, and two business partners, Allison Davis and his son, Jared Davis, bought with some of the $68 million their company, DV Urban Realty Partners, was hired to manage for five city pension funds. Robert Vanecko left DV Urban in summer 2009.

In 2010, the Eagles moved up in the first round to take defensive end Brandon Graham, who was not able to hold down the starting job he had coming out of training camp, then tore an ACL late in his rookie season and had to have microfracture surgery as part of the repair. Last season turned out to be a wash as he never did get back to 100 percent.

He smiled as he said that and understands it's part of learning, but there was a lot to not like in the final minutes by Ohio State. In the end, it probably is more important for the Buckeyes to take away the good feeling of pulling out a tight win, something that this team did need.
Indeed, time, not Apple, may be the best thing the Nasdaq has going for it right now. Unlike the Dow, which looks to be on its way to making its third top since the turn of the millennium, the Nasdaq has been in a full-blown bear market for 12 years. As market maven Mark Hulbert notes, “No bear market in US history has been as awful as the Nasdaq since 2000.”
Chilo Rachal (San Francisco): He is 6-5, 323 pounds and he’s only 26 years old, but consistency certainly has been an issue. Rachal started 15 games in 2009 and 14 in 2010, but he was replaced on the 49ers’ starting offensive line this past season. The former second-round pick has some upside. He was ranked by Pro Football Focus as the top run-blocking guard in 2010, and he’s currently ranked by Pro Football Talk as the top remaining free agent guard available. However, it’s difficult to imagine Ravens coach John Harbaugh advocating the addition of a player that his brother, Jim, demoted from the starting lineup because of his penchant for committing penalities. Rachal has already visited the Rams.
An official said the clothing of both Castaing and Velez was splattered with blood. When the pair made their first court appearance on the charges Thursday afternoon, they had been provided with sweatshirts and sweatpants.

The park is in east San Diego County, but extends into portions of Imperial and Riverside counties. Plan on a drive of at least 2.5 hours. Many visitors approach from the east or west via Highways S22 and 78. For Orange County residents in the north and central county, the shortest drive time might be to head northeast to Corona and take Interstate 15 south to Temecula, then take Highway 79 southeast via Warner Hot Springs and enter the park via S22.
The draft is good for one thing and one thing only: It is a nationally televised truth serum. After all the blather and smoke thrown out by NFL teams, the reality leaks out when they finally must make their picks. That's when you discover what the teams truly believe they need, the areas where they think they are most lacking, the roster crevices that they are most desperate to fill.
The whole saga started last summer, when I first heard that Florida-based Revolution3 was planning to stage full and half ultra-distance triathlons Sept. 12 at "America's Roller Coast." I trembled at the thought of such long races, but as a fitness enthusiast, there was no way I was going to stand back and merely observe the historic first running of the largest multi-sport event in Northeast Ohio.

It presented tough choices, too, for Beijing, whose violent crackdown on pro-democracy protesters at Tiananmen Square 23 years ago is the portrait of its human rights behavior retained by much of the world. Chinese leaders still are extremely concerned about internal security and chafe at any foreign criticism of the nation's domestic affairs. But China also has become increasingly conscious of its global image.

Buckhorn is certainly a destination for a special occasion, but it's also comfortable if you just step in off the street wearing blue jeans and a T-shirt. During our visits, we saw all kinds of folks  older couples, families, young folks and groups of big dudes who ate as if they had just been rescued from a deserted island.
“You need to find out what the income tax consequences are for your winnings,” Meckler said. “For instance, you may might be better off forming a trust to receive your winnings.”

Kelly von Plonski, who owns Subterranean Books in University City, also said of ebooks: "We've never sold a ton but we do have some dedicated buyers.

Nordstrom, which opened its West County Mall department store in 2002, plans to open a second location in the region at the Galleria next September.
"Julius is an enormous factor on anybody's team because you just have to pay so much attention to where he is because he can change the game in one play," said Sea-hawks coach Pete Carroll. "So we have to find ways to keep him from being the factor. They have enough really outstanding players on that football team that they call for us in many areas to really pay attention to them."

When the Broncos signed Manning on March 20 to a five-year contract with only the first year's salary guaranteed, Elway was asked whether there was a backup plan in case Manning's health faltered.
This is not at all to suggest that "An Ideal Wine" is a tell-all screed. One of Darlington's strengths is that he is able to pull back the curtain on the wine business without ever losing sight that the beverage itself is capable of great magic. He takes us into the worlds of utterly opposite wine figures — or so it seems.

With all of the horses seemingly healthy -- and you know how quickly that can change -- the focus here will be on the style of the race. Trinniberg, as I wrote in my story on the draw, is the wild card. Having never raced more than seven furlongs, his connections nevertheless feel convinced that their horse will win the race. Does such wild-eyed confidence mean they're prepared to let him dash from the gates and see how far he'll go? Top trainers such as Bob Baffert and Graham Motion deferred when asked yesterday how they thought the race might unfurl, saying that it would be up to the jockeys.

The first time you run across one of these things, which is a mutantly large xiao long bao, you may try to lift it with a soup spoon, the way you would an ordinary soup dumpling, and it will tear itself apart with its own floppy weight.

Barcelona is the place to see a wild and wonderfully inventive form of Art Nouveau architecture called modernisme. Catalan architects led by Antoni Gaudi (1852-1926) and Lluis Domenech I Montaner (1850-1923) rebelled against mass production and structures with straight lines by designing buildings with asymmetrical undulating forms, using bold colors and unusual materials. These structures are a joy to behold and clearly illustrate why the world goes gaga over Gaudi and his colleagues.

Another benefit of a national policy would be improved coverage between states. Vaccine-preventable diseases are not contained within state borders, and our vaccine policies should not be either. With the status quo, lax immunization policies in one state can lead to outbreaks in neighboring states. In addition, a national policy would increase equity for children who live in different states. Currently, fewer than 0.1 percent of kindergartners are exempt from vaccines in Mississippi, a state that does not permit religious or philosophical exemptions. In contrast, 6.2 percent of children are exempt from vaccines in Washington state, a state where both religious and philosophical exemptions are allowed. Geographic location should not influence access to lifesaving vaccines.

“What bothers me the most, I think, is when they talked about getting our town government involved, in regards to sending a taxing authority to the church,” said Vernacchio. “To question what the church is doing, that’s not even our jurisdiction.”
On the other side, Bob Filner has no plan other than to suggest the city borrow hundreds of millions of dollars in "casino" bonds. This would expose taxpayers to even more risk and leave it to future generations to confront the cost of pension liability.

And to think, the Bears had been faring better against Rodgers than most NFL teams. But they usually have to reel him in over the course of the game. In last season's NFC Championship Game, Rodgers completed 8 of 11 passes for 148 yards as the Packers opened a 14-0 lead. The Bears eventually caught on - Rodgers was 9-of-19 for 96 yards and two interceptions after that, but the damage was done.
"I knew I could make the team,'' said Scanlan, a graduate of St. Paul Central who will compete in her first Olympics.

Boning up: Forensic scientists say they can estimate the weight of a human for which a skeleton is found -- usually a very inexact guess -- based on the shape of the femur bone.

The source of bones: The Cleveland Museum of Natural History.
But in one key way, their emotional responses did not return to a normal push-pull pattern. These soldiers' emotional regulation response--high activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex--still did not automatically go quiet when the amygdala became active, or kick back in when the amygdala returned to its resting state. The authors suggested that this disturbed state may be a remnant of their stress response to combat--a scar that may heal in some and reopen in others, possibly leading to post-traumatic stress disorder.
While power struggles, conflicting values and other disagreements can emerge in multi-generational households, Van Fossen said, there are benefits to those arrangements beyond the financial ones. Among them is emotional support from family members.

Gluzman played the work on a great sounding Stradivarius once owned by Leopold Auer, the original dedicatee of the concerto.

It's not the sweet tea. It's the butter, the beef and the bacon. Paula Deen has finally confirmed rumors that she has diabetes and laid out a plan to fight it -- and she even wants to serve as a role model for the millions of other Americans battling this disease.

Its general manager, java connoisseur Scott Soohoo, tells us all about coffee in general and Peet's in particular. His spiel is a bit too long, but I learn that it's better to use a gold cone, not paper filters, and to freeze, not refrigerate, my coffee beans (but subsequently, I couldn't tell any difference).

A few minutes before the intros, Mason went on his mic and carefully explained what he was trying to do, but much of the crowd (announced as 18,209) wasn't seated yet.

In general, low-budget films stand to benefit the most proportionately by winning because they have received less hype and exposure, the report said. Last year’s winner, "The Hurt Locker," reaped $17 million in box office receipts and cost just $11 million to make. "Slumdog Millionaire," the winner from 2009, raked in $54 million after its Oscar nomination, nearly four times its budget.

On Thursday, Kyl acknowledged that "some people stay too long" and stressed that there are other things to do in life. Kyl may even have considered retiring after his second Senate term, he said, had there not been concern that Republicans might lose his seat in 2006, a brutal year nationally for the GOP in which the party lost control of both chambers.

When we talked, Davis was working on her own schedule for the week after Christmas. The pediatrician of more than 30 years expects her two young grandkids to visit this week. She knows the 1-year-old and 4-year-old will be tired upon arrival after catching flights right after Christmas from the West Coast. They will be off schedule and around people they don't often see. In addition, they might be a bit disappointed about not being at home.
The Magi meet Mary and Joseph, and it's curious that the child is never identified by name as Jesus or Christ. It seems strange, but, as Landau explains, there is an intentional reason for this omission: "If the Magi in the first-person narrative come to the end of the story without ever using the name, this implies that they have had an experience of Christ without ever knowing this savior figure as Christ. The case of the Magi, then, raises the possibility that Christ has appeared to many people and yet not revealed himself as Jesus Christ."

The challenge for pastors is to retell a story that's well known to regular churchgoers, familiar to some visitors and a curiosity to others. Striking the right balance between information and inspiration pushes pastors back to the Bible. In the weeks before Easter, they sift through commentaries in search of a better way to break open the good news.
Many of the facilities have been stretched well beyond their capacity. The Hickey School, designed for 72 youths, housed more than that for nearly seven months of 2011, hitting a high of 97, according to the report.

Hey, Tony: Why didn't the Browns look at Marty Schottenheimer as a potential head coach -- before hiring Shurmur? Apparently, Marty might get back in at Tampa Bay. In my view, it must have been Mike Holmgren's huge ego that didn't allow him to at least interview Marty for the Browns job last year. Granted he's never led a team to the Super Bowl (to date), but I'd take Marty's skills over Shurmur's any day. -- Terry Holzemer, Palo Alto, Calif.

The latest affront comes courtesy of the burning of Qurans by U.S. soldiers on a military base near Kabul. Military officials maintain the Qurans were being used by imprisoned jihadists to pass messages to other prisoners and were confiscated and destroyed. A spokesman for the NATO-led force said the troops, "... should have known to check with cultural advisers to determine how to dispose of religious material properly." For this unintended action, however, Mr. Karzai wants the soldiers to be put on trial and has asked NATO commanders to allow it. If they do, they will have disgraced their uniform.

Under Supreme Court precedents, restrictions on free speech by federally licensed broadcasters must be "narrowly tailored to further a substantial governmental interest." In this case, the asserted interest was Congress' desire to preserve educational programming on public stations. In the court's main opinion, Judge Carlos T. Bea concluded that Congress had good reason to worry that the lure of revenue from ads for commercial products might induce public broadcasters to replace educational programming with fare more likely to garner higher ratings. But Bea said there wasn't "substantial evidence in the record before Congress" to suggest that children's and other educational programming would be similarly endangered by a station's acceptance of political ads. (He ridiculed the notion that a station eager for political ads might air a cartoon in which Mitt Romney or Barack Obama fought crime alongside Superman or Batman.)

This one's a no-brainer: Replace every lightbulb in your house with a compact fluorescent lightbulb (CFL). They cost more to buy than incandescent bulbs, but they use 75 percent less energy, so they pay for themselves and then some over their lifetime in the form of lower energy bills. In fact, you can save $30 a year by replacing just one incandescent with a CFL.

Comparing photos of just one person is a much easier task—the accuracy rates are high, and have been growing. In tests last year by researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a U.S. government agency, facial-recognition software incorrectly said that two photos of the same person weren't a match less than 1% of the time. In similar tests in 1993, when facial-recognition technology was still nascent, the software was unable to identify two matching photos roughly four out of five times. In all the tests, the software falsely identified a match between two photos of different people less than one time in a thousand.

The contortions by the Republican candidates illustrate the straddle they're attempting on a complex issue. In order to win the Republican nomination, they must court a GOP electorate that is largely against anything that could be called "amnesty" for illegal immigrants. But they can't come off as anti-immigrant, a stance that could alienate the independents and moderates -- not to mention Hispanics -- they'd need to attract in a general election should they win the party's nod to challenge President Barack Obama.

Your dentist can evaluate whether bleaching is right for your teeth, since different kinds of discoloration respond differently to whitening. For example, bleaching works for most stains caused by age, smoking, and regular coffee or tea drinking, but it may not be effective against discoloration that results from tetracycline use in children under age 8. (Tooth discoloration can also occur in a child whose mother took tetracycline while pregnant.) Finally, even if you choose the over-the-counter route, your dentist can advise you on the relative merits of the products available.

If the Browns turn the page on Dawson, the tag could be saved as insurance to keep Jackson from leaving in free agency. The expected value of the franchise tag for linebackers will be about $9 million. That's a pretty high cap number. The Browns more likely will want to save ample cap room for free agent spending on their beleaguered offense and reduce Jackson's cap number by negotiating a multi-year contract.
The World War I death of her 18-year-old son Peter, killed within a month after he enlisted, marked her work from then on. Her most powerful piece about war seems to anticipate her grief. Done in 1907, it is a centerpiece of her series "The Peasants' Revolt" about a 1525 uprising. Most of the peasants were killed, of course, and in "The Battlefield," she depicts a mother searching for the body of her child in the darkness, the only light illuminating her gnarled fingers as she lifts the chin of a corpse.

A slut is basically someone whose behavior has a negative impact on themselves and society, yet they still keep doing it. They act out without being responsible.

GOP sneak attack update. A month or so back, Republican Assemblyman Chuck DeVore of Irvine had - unbeknownst to him, as it turned out - let me in on his political strategy for "eff-ing" with the Democrats, as he put it. Speaking at Chapman, he'd disclosed his plan behind a bill he'd authored to give a five-year "holiday" to the state's tough environmental law, the California Environmental Quality Act. This exemption from CEQA would apply only to inner-city infill development projects, low-income housing and farm-worker housing.

For the women, the rallying cause was defeating the Equal Rights Amendment. They viewed the ERA as undermining women's God-given traditional role and, with it, an idealized nuclear family. These grass-roots activists lobbied successfully to block ERA ratification in just 15 states, sending the nationally popular amendment down to defeat. They then moved on to battle sex education in public schools, federally funded child care and gay civil rights. (Abortion, importantly, was not an early concern. Evangelical Protestants, for example, because of their strong support for separation of church and state, were largely pro-choice through most of the 1970s.)

For most stars, Chicago is out of sight, out of mind, but there are exceptions. Steppenwolf ensemble member John Mahoney kept his home in Oak Park throughout the run of "Frasier" and has been working in local theater steadily ever since. William Petersen of "CSI" fame maintains a home here and occasionally performs around town. Every so often, David Schwimmer directs a play at Lookingglass. Tracy Letts became a hot commodity — and a Pulitzer Prize winner — after writing "August: Osage County," and yet he still lives and works in Chicago at the Steppenwolf. (And he recently jumped onstage with old pal Pasquesi for an improv set at iO last month.) Michael Shannon has since moved to New York, but six months after his Oscar nomination for "Revolutionary Road," he was back in Chicago performing for 74 people a night in the tiny storefront space of his hometown theater, A Red Orchid, a small but first-rate company coming up on its 20th anniversary.

Back to the new poll: 34 percent of voters say they approve of the way Portman is handling his job as a U.S. senator, and 16 percent disapprove. There is hope in these numbers, because a healthy 51 percent said they just don't know. Considering that so far, Portman's only official act as a senator was his swearing-in -- after which the Senate took a break (it'll come back next week) -- we go back to our original point: It's awfully early.

"We have a great understanding," Casey said. "We've played almost three years together, kind of came to the club at the same time, and are very complementary to each other. I think he definitely missed me, and I missed not playing with him. With his speed and my size, and our understanding, it makes it a lot easier for him to do what he can do.

Shaken, humbled and inarguably transformed, Henry is talking as much about the superstitious fan who freezes between pitches as he is the idea that even the most tightly controlled among us can lead a life free of errors.

"I am shocked and extremely disappointed by the NFL's decision to suspend me for the 2012 season. Commissioner Roger Goodell has refused to share any of the supposed evidence he claims supports this unprecedented punishment. The reason is clear: I never paid , or intended to pay, $10,000, or any amount of money, to any player for knocking Kurt Warner, Brett Favre or any other player, out of the 2009 divisional playoff game, 2010 NFC Championship Game, or any other game. I never set out to intentionally hurt any player and never enticed any teammate to intentionally hurt another player. I also never put any into a bounty pool or helped to create a bounty pool intended to pay out money for injuring other players. I have always conducted myself in a professional and proud manner. I intend to fight this injustice, to defend my reputation, to stand up for my team and my profession, and to send a clear signal to the commissioner that the process has failed, to the detriment of me, my teammates, the New Orleans Saints and the game."

(Pran escaped, later moving to the U.S., where he died in 2008.)

I had a practice session at Buckeye Lanes after work on Thursday and was reasonably pleased with the results. I bowled 13 games in 57 minutes and averaged north of 200 using alley balls and one of my own. The back and quad felt great before, during and after. The only hangup was my pulse, which skyrocketed early and forced me to take 30-second breaks every 5-6 minutes. I'm not sure what the problem was/is.

The speech was pure preaching to the choir on the bailout, and it came from a self-serving politician. But the messenger came with a credibility out of his own blue-collar background, the lack of which has haunted and stymied Mr. Romney throughout this year's presidential campaign.
Food Network chef Tyler Florence was there to tout his baby food line, Sprout, which is fresh, nutritious and so delicious, he says, “Models in L.A. are eating Sprout Baby Food as a snack. ... For babies, this is the most important stage of their lives. The food has got to be delicious.”

All of us loved Jim's work and were even slightly humbled by it. He was so damn good. He was so damn good looking, a tall redhead with pale, almost transparent skin, and a confident, athletic grace.

"Will the tax credit be renewed?" says Walker. "I don't know. But I would argue that the $32 million raised and $20 million awarded means a lot of people have made investments in this thing and that before you decide to eliminate the credit, you should give it a little thought."

The next night Pinto and his wife, Miralba, arrived at the roadblock near the mine after 11 p.m. The guards wanted to know who they were and why they were there. When he explained, they seemed confused, and called his request to authority after authority. Finally, they let them through.
The federal government has taken over 17 failing banks and thrifts this year, seizing them at a rate three times faster than last year. At that pace, it will "nationalize" 85 banks by year's end, compared with three -- yes, three three -- in 2007. Yet many analysts and investors wonder whether the government should be taking over more financial institutions, particularly a number of "too big to fail" firms that may not have the money to cover their expanding losses. The push for nationalizing big, troubled firms is coming from liberals and conservatives alike, as is the resistance. President Obama, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and other top administration officials have spoken out against nationalization, yet their comments haven't provided much reassurance to investors fearful of being wiped out by a federal takeover. That uncertainty is hampering the financial industry's recovery, potentially dragging the government -- and taxpayers -- more deeply into the mess.

The Alpine nation gave local authorities permission in May to destroy expired swine flu vaccines after finding its storerooms were full of unused stock. A total of 20 people died from swine flu in Switzerland — out of almost 5,000 across Europe.

The dramatic action is a result of legislation the state passed last year in response to an epidemic common in many states, including Missouri. Over the past couple of decades, as legislatures and prosecutors have gotten tough on crime, specifically drug offenses, prisons have filled up, and corrections budgets have become bloated, with little to show for it.

Roam delivers good value, but I must say the burger prices can send the eyebrows up. The elk burger runs $18 — OK, game meat and all that — but a basic beef burger costs $16. Even a veggie burger is $15. Those are Manhattan prices, and seem out of line with the rest of the menu.

How strange, then, that "Farther Away" contains more to like than to love. There's something to be said for a push toward clarity and consistency. In "How to Be Alone," his previous collection of nonfiction, Franzen described rereading the Harper's essay - "an essay, evidently written by me, that began with a five-thousand-word complaint of such painful stridency and tenuous logic that even I couldn't quite follow it."

Eventually, the mayor said, he wants the city to switch over to flex-fuel SUVs that use biofuel, or hybrids. Newark already has environmental conservation built into its master plan, design guidelines and economic development strategies. The city provides incentives for green building, has helped distribute more than 9,000 energy-saving light bulbs, and created the first Newark Environmental Commission in March.
More importantly, safety issues — which had been a major concern of many residents whose properties surround the site — were addressed in the conditional approval of the plan, according to Mayor Joseph Petsch.

As Mayo plied the seas, his exploits grew more spectacular. While protecting a schooner returning freed slaves to a new settlement in Africa, he suffered musket burns when he came face-to-face with King Crako, the chief of a local tribe. Later, during the Mexican War, he moved his ships' guns onto land, using them to topple the walls surrounding Veracruz before the 1847 battle that took the port town.

Parents, discouraged by the changes they see in their children, naturally try to intervene. They may encourage their kids to spend less time with friends they perceive as troublemakers or forbid these friendships entirely. But interfering in a teenager's life too much, particularly with friendships, can make matters worse. "Meddling with children's relationships has a high potential for backfiring," Prinstein says. "It can actually fuel rebellion."

The plan is patently unconstitutional because Congress cannot delegate its' core responsibilities to the president. For example, Congress cannot give the president its authority to declare war. The Supreme Court held the legislation granting a line item veto unconstitutional because Congress could not authorize the president to eliminate individual appropriated items, appropriations a core Congressional power. Thus, the president could not today be empowered to unilaterally say what appropriated programs would be stricken. Congress has historically been indifferent to the constitutionality of legislation, leaving it to the courts to decide years later after the crises have passed.
This city dotted with factories and hugging the lake is reflected in Meyer: The hard-working intensity, the gritty and disciplined demeanor, the demand for nothing less than excellence because he knows too well what failure can look like.

Wafels & Dinges, a pioneer of the New York City truck food scene, opened its first store on the Seaside boardwalk last month. If you go expecting crunchy IHOP waffles, you’ll be disappointed. The waffles at W&D are soft, chewy and mildly sweet. The Munchers didn’t seem wowed by the waffles — Mark Jay called them “overpriced and overhyped” — but the Belgian Madness, with Hoegaarden White Ale and honey, is an unexpected delight.
Peppering his routines with "man" and "dig it" and lapsing into Yiddish, Cuiffo's Lenny is eerily precise, unlike Dustin Hoffman's, who sounded nothing like Bruce in the 1974 biopic.

New Orleans came to mind once more as we viewed a room dominated by the fiery colors, glittery costumes and historic photos of Carnival. Plaza Machado is the epicenter of one of the country's liveliest celebrations, and Casa Machado's Mardi Gras Parlor pays tribute to Carnival queens going back to 1900.
After months of political posturing, hours of public hearings, and a bi-partisan report that agreed with Christie’s view that state-run TV was no longer viable, the governor and lawmakers agreed last year on a compromise. Lawmakers overwhelmingly passed a bill, which Christie signed in December, granting Sidamon-Eristoff the authority to negotiate a management agreement with a private entity to take control of the New Jersey Network’s TV operation. The Legislature would have 15 days after receipt of the contract to vote it down, according to the law.

I didn't know the gardens existed until I read "The Da Vinci Code." You can find them by taking the low, dark passage past a small museum, housed in the remnants of the 1065 abbey, and through a small door that opens into a cloister with a fountain in the middle. Off to the right is an enormous green space with trees, flower beds and a lawn.

Other anniversary activities include a special Mass and reception on June 9 in addition to further concert programs and events.
Supporters trying to visit Chen at the hospital were roughly turned away, with some saying they were beaten by plainclothes police. China's state-controlled newspapers launched scathing attacks on Chen and on U.S. Ambassador Gary Locke, who helped Chen enter the embassy April 26 after his escape from de facto house arrest in his village in Shandong province. In addition, some of Chen's allies remain under house arrest.
Films like "Miss Representation" will receive a better fate, Huttner insists, when "more women go to the movies and support women filmmakers. When we vote with our dollars, Hollywood notices. And then this gives more women the chance to express themselves." Citing research by professor Martha Lauzen at San Diego State University, she notes that men write and direct almost 90 percent of all Hollywood films. "The only way an artist gets to make better art is to get more chances to do so," Huttner said. "The only way someone gets better is by practicing their craft."
øIf you live in a high-tax state, then munis from your state can be exceptional. A nine-year California muni bond offered Thursday was yielding 2.68%. Let's say you were in California's maximum 10.3% tax bracket and the U.S. 35% tax bracket. To earn 2.68% after taxes, you'd need to find a bond yielding 4.9%.

One question remains: How is Posh going to handle success? It's one thing for Hebert to make a one-on-one customer connection when maybe 15 or 20 diners show up. But what's going to happen when the 65 counter and table seats start filling up? Will he have time to talk about his fish supplier, his year in Japan or how he makes beet leather? Instead of lingering to explain the delights of an Italian white made from the Kerner grape, a varietal most Americans have never heard of, will the sommelier have to pour and run?
Split into squads, the gunmen loosed gunfire and rocket-propelled grenades at Afghan and foreign targets.

Night had fallen without sound or ceremony when I came out again. (30) The silence pursued me like dumb ghosts, the still air held my breath, the hellish fog caught at my feet like cold hands. (31) It was a female figure, dressed in black. She was seated on one of the lower steps of the scaffold, leaning forward, her face hid in her lap, and her long disheveled tresses hanging to the ground, streaming with the rain which fell in torrents. (32) The flower heads were heavy with sodden, brown-edged petals and their stalks bent wearily as if cognizant of the fact that their lives were held by a tenuous thread that was soon to be snapped between the chill, biting teeth of an early frost. (33) I was compelled to make a drawing of it, almost against my will, since anything so outré is hardly in my line. (34)
Bomhoff, not a reptile the last time we checked, will of course need all the water and electrolytes he can stomach over the 30 hours or so it will take to traverse a course featuring mile after mile of flat pavement that can get glutinous in the shimmering heat of day, followed by a climactic 13-mile, 5,000-foot climb to the finish line on Mount Whitney.

Homer shows us both the human and the animal aspects of his ancient warriors. The driving desire for glory, for honor, and the passionate loyalty to comrades are certainly not bad traits but in war have led humans to commit horrific atrocities against each other. The tragedy as O'Hare and Peterson eloquently underscore is that brutal and brutalizing war is so deeply embedded in the human experience. The capacity for animal rage lies just beneath the surface of all so-called civilized behavior, and this fact is something we need to know.
Discerning the difference is not always easy; for close to 20 years, I've made it my business, and I still get fooled occasionally. But more often than not, following a few simple guidelines will be a big help.

"There was a guy we targeted that we had a lot of interest in," Buccaneers GM Mark Dominik said. "For a couple reasons we made that trade for Doug Martin. No. 1 who he is, a great team leader at Boise State … a productive football player. We felt like we wanted to get a back in this year's draft and felt he was a complete back. To do that, what happens also is you … end up with a five-year deal on a first-year pick's contract, which is important to me because that is extra value you get that isn't always seen."
Which means everyone else is deluded. And thinking about that will make you crazy. If you already aren't.

In buying Gen-Probe, Hologic is gaining access to such things as TIGRIS and PANTHER, automated instruments that can be used with assays to test for a variety of diseases. Gen-Probe is currently seeking U.S. regulatory approval to use PANTHER in conjunction with APTIMA, an assay that tests for chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Catch restrictions loom on menhaden, which is too unsavory to grace a dinner plate but much sought by commercial fishermen. They catch them in staggering numbers to be ground into animal feed, to extract their heart-healthy oils for humans and to be used as bait to catch other fish, including Maryland's iconic blue crabs.

Last June, Schwerdt told The Oregonian that he'd used marijuana and other medications for debilitating back and knee pain that sometimes prevented him from walking. Washington County denied him a concealed handgun renewal, he fought it and in 2005 Circuit Judge Marco Hernandez ruled in his favor. A county attorney said that was because he couldn't prove Schwerdt actually owned a gun. Washington County later pulled Schwerdt's license. He went to court again, and Circuit Judge Steven Price ruled in favor of Schwerdt and two other cannabis cardholders.
One does not need to be a 14-year old stuck in a dress shop to realize burnout is a spiritual as well as cultural problem. Despite the otherwise robust German economy, for example, recent figures show that nearly one in ten sick days in that country are related to burnout.

INDIANAPOLIS - Derrick Rose blew into the lane for a vintage left-handed layup in the first quarter. It was startling because it happened so quickly and because it has been so long since we've seen Rose do what he does best.
The devices have been a great addition to the enrichment programs Jungle Island already does with the orangutans, Jacobs said. Keepers have long used sign language to communicate with them. Using their hands, the orangutans can respond to simple questions, identify objects and express their wants or needs. The apes can also identify body parts, helping the trainers care for them and even give them shots.

That was how Ballpark Village was pitched when introduced to the region 10 years ago this month. Cardinals owners talked that the demand for office and residential space next to a new downtown ballpark was so great that the complex covering 10 acres could be built as early as 2006 to coincide with the opening of the new ballpark. But that deadline and scope of work quickly moved to July 2009, when the team said a first phase of the village would be open when the Cardinals hosted the All-Star Game.
We should get ready to retire 50% of today's coal plants and put wind, solar, geothermal and biomass power at the center of our electricity supply system. In 25 years, the U.S. should have a "renewable electron economy," with 70% of its electricity from renewables. Big solar plants built with heat storage could handle much of the summer peak demand. Geothermal plants would run around the clock, displacing large amounts of coal power. And when the wind blows, we would conserve fossil fuels. All of the renewables will be working together, integrated in a widely cross-linked grid that combines large and small generators and overcomes the weaknesses of green technologies.

Chrismer said in the email that because of the low voter turnout, it didn't take long to recount the ballots in the two precincts where the memory cards failed. Those precincts have a combined total of 5,540 registered voters. If a similar problem would occur in the Nov. 6 presidential election, hand-feeding ballots from a 90 percent turnout, for instance, would take hours.
In a now infamous oped column in the New York Times, Romney argued in late 2008 that President George W. Bush and Congress should deny General Motors and Chrysler the bailouts they were seeking, because the money would go to waste. Only bankruptcy, with government guarantees of financing after the process, would turn the companies around, Romney wrote.
The 4G HotSpot's range is supposed to be up to 150 feet, and this was about right in my experience. If it hasn't been used for 30 minutes and isn't connected to any Wi-Fi enabled devices, it goes into Sleep Mode as a means for saving battery.

Massey conducted an extensive survey showing that Mexicans' desire to come to work in the U.S. has fallen to its lowest level since the 1950s. The economic downturn, improved border security and a record number of deportations have caused Mexicans to think twice about crossing the border. Improving conditions in Mexico also explain the diminished flow of Mexicans moving north.

As the draft ground on, surely a wide receiver would soon be identified and selected. After all, the "coach 'em up" plan had misfired last season as badly as a Ryan Pontbriand snap. Moreover, to paraphrase Gisele Bundchen's remarks after the Super Bowl about Tom Brady, Brandon can't throw it and catch it, too.

The Irish government protests it doesn't need aid, at least not yet, because it has sufficient funds through mid-2011 and is planning euro6 billion ($8 billion) in 2011 cuts and tax hikes. However, it has suggested that direct EU aid to its cash-strapped banks would boost Ireland's creditworthiness, since the government has guaranteed the banks' financial obligations.

According to Joyce, Zbikowski got a $100,000 purse for his first heavyweight fight in 2006, which was more than ‘‘Sugar'' Ray Leonard or Oscar de la Hoya received for their debuts. If all goes well, his pay-per-view appeal might allow him - eventually - to make more for one fight than he will during his entire NFL career.
Tasers are legal in 43 other states. A legislative analysis of the bills Snyder signed says it stands to reason that if individuals who meet CPL (concealed pistol license) licensing standards are trusted with carrying a firearm for personal safety, the law should not ban them from carrying an EMD for the same purpose.
So to set the scene, Eli has his shoulders slouched and is stammering through the opening lines when a familiar face steps onto the stage. “This is unacceptable!” Tom Coughlin yells. “These people paid good money to see you at your best.

Prosecutors sometime cluster defendants by case, meaning the number of defendants could be higher than five, said Bob Dekle, a University of Florida law professor.

The Rockies desperately need a starter to step up and take on some innings. Can right-hander Juan Nicasio be that guy tonight vs. the Dodgers? So far during this homestand, Rockies starters have gone four innings (Drew Pomeranz on Friday), five innings (Guillermo Moscoso, Saturday) and five innings (Jamie Moyer, Sunday). Nicasio is coming off a solid outing in Pittsburgh, where he pitched 6-2/3 innings in a no-decision. He scattered nine hits, allowed one run and struck out five. Trouble is, the Dodgers knocked Nicasio around pretty good in the two games they've faced him. He's 0-1 with a 7.59 ERA against Los Angeles. Dodgers slugger Matt Kemp is 3-for-6 with a home and three RBIs against Nicasio.

Professional tooth scaling appears to reduce the inflammation-causing bacterial growth that can lead to heart disease or stroke, she said.

Why have the results of China's record-breaking production of new opera houses and concert halls been so visually striking and so functionally uneven? The multipurpose "Grand Theaters" built as the centerpieces of China's instant new cities and new business districts have been conceived less as finely tuned music venues, along Western lines, than as nationalistic symbols featuring propagandistic displays and popular Italian operas and Broadway musicals. Are they now moving toward more sophisticated artistic and musical performance and management? Ms. Newhouse thinks so, citing Ms. Hadid's recent Guangzhou Opera House, two extraordinary, rocklike structures in contrasting white and black marble inspired by stones in a nearby riverbed, where equal attention has been paid to design and acoustics. And there are still more to come from a list of international architectural superstars.

Jersey City Firefighter Mike Harris and the American Red Cross will sponsor an event to find a genetically compatible bone marrow donor for his son Trevor. The event will be held on Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the Mary Mcleod Bethune Center, 140 Martin Luther King Jr. Drive in Jersey City. The bone marrow donor screening requires the swabbing of the inside of a potential donor's mouth with a Q-tip. That Q-tip will be sent off to a lab to determine if the donor is a match. Once a genetically matched donor has been identified, healthy bone marrow cells from the donor will be transfused into Trevor's system. For more information call Mike Harris at (732) 433-6070 or e-mail Mike at waxmanast@yahoo.com.

Tim Brown, Yahoo! Sports: "The best news is McCourt is gone. The second-best is Magic will one day sit in the field boxes near the third-base dugout, wave those big ol' arms, smile that big ol' smile, and sign a stinkin' left fielder. Other people will get caught up in what McCourt and his ex did here. What they did to the franchise. How they made people feel here. Other people will wonder what the hell is wrong with a world in which gluttony triumphs and dignity runs down the leg of Major League Baseball. But, that's not what's being toasted in Echo Park, in East L.A., in Van Nuys, in Pasadena, in Hancock Park. The Dodgers had become an emotional and civic burden. Under Fox and then McCourt, in a time when the Los Angeles Angels thrived and the only thing on television was New York Yankees-Boston Red Sox, the Dodgers too often showed up wearing high-water pants and yesterday's T-shirt. Today, assuming McCourt navigates a mid-April bankruptcy court ruling and the Guggenheim Baseball Partners' deal survives a late-April MLB vetting, the Dodgers are dignified again."

It's 850-488-7146. Speaking of which, the last time I spoke to the governor by phone, it didn't go so well. I had left a message for him a couple of weeks ago. And the next morning, my cell phone rang — at 6:25 a.m. Usually I'm up by 6. But this day, I was in the midst of deep sleep. So I hear the ring, fly out of bed like my sheets were on fire and answer the phone in a voice that sounded like a bullfrog with a mouthful of gravel. "This is … um … Scott." On the other end is a voice peppier than a high-school cheerleader: "Hi Scott!! It's Charlie Crist! I know it's early! But I was up and running! So I thought I'd call now! I didn't wake you, did I?" I'm not sure what it is about that question that makes us all lie. But we do. And I did, saying something about how I'd been up for hours and had already run a few errands. Then we did the interview.

Second, President Obama's "accommodation" calls for the Insurance companies — not the individuals, church or corporation buying the premium — to pay for birth-control. This is nonsense.

In Darkness is also, pivotally, the story of a city sewer worker, Leopold Socha (Robert Wieckiewicz). A married man, a Gentile, whose moral core seems fairly coreless at first, Socha takes money to harbor the Jews - guiding them to hideouts, bringing food and supplies. It was a mercernary act, not a missionary one, but over the course of the year and two months that he served as their secret guardian, Socha undergoes his own transformation. Like many of his Polish brethren, he felt antipathy toward the folks with the stars sewn on their clothes, living in the ghetto. But as he comes to know them, playing with the children and befriending Mundek (Benno Fürmann), a brawny thug who insists on returning aboveground to look for a missing girl, Socha puts himself at risk, sacrificing his own safety and standing in the community to help the frightened fugitives.

- Overall, I think this is the right move -- overdue, but the right move. I'm troubled, though, by one thing: When the pressure rises, Adams' basic tendency seems to be to fudge the facts. When he handed the bureau off last year, he said it was so he could focus on his bigger priorities: Planning the city's physical future, lowering the dropout rate and putting our economy in position to rebound quickly once the national fiscal crisis passes. But at his press conference Wednesday, he said he'd given away the bureau to make "structural reforms that had gone lagging for decades. We've completed them." That's just nonsense. He gave away the bureau because he had other things he thought were more important.

Marcelo Gomes was burdened with that often thankless role, the hero. Strong of jaw and manly of bearing, the character is well suited to the seasoned Brazilian, and it has been given some comic touches by Ratmansky which Gomes slyly capitalized on. As he's about to walk through a door into Kaschei's menacing world Ivan steels himself, then quickly makes the sign of the cross before the journey. It's simultaneously touching and comic – the hero acknowledging his mortality – and Gomes conveyed the moment nicely.

Tomorrow night's show won't address that deficiency all at once, but it is a step in the right direction. Several locals have coaxed Mike Dillon — better known as Mike D — to a club right across the street from the state capitol building. Dillon, who comes to New Jersey from New Orleans, is probably the world's foremost punk-rock vibraphonist — and if that sounds like something of a contradiction to you, chances are, you haven't caught him in action. The musician plays jazz with the intensity of a buzzsaw rhythm guitarist, and invests his grooves with the freewheeling spirit of a funk master. Dillon has played with Les Claypool and Ani DiFranco; his 2009 release, "Rock Star Bench Press," revealed a fiery and occasionally confrontational political conscience, too. This show is a benefit: proceeds from the evening go to making the venue a permanent pop fixture in the Garden State's capital. Now, there's a cause worth believing in. Appearing tomorrow night at the Contemporary Club, 176 W. State St., Trenton, 7 p.m.; $10; call (609) 392-9727.

Already, a researcher from the Harvard Graduate School of Education, using the MIT Circuits course, found that students overwhelmingly preferred to read the handwritten notes of Agarwal rather than the same notes presented on PowerPoint.

"They could blow us out," Harbaugh says before adding that Stanford could also do the same to Virginia Tech. I'm not sure I've ever heard a coach make that kind of prediction.

Moreover, the new money would be considered a onetime grant.

Dancing Queen, revisited: Andy returns to the ballroom dancing episode in which Danielle gets angry at Teresa's husband Joe for repeatedly using the word gay. Teresa and Caroline say Joe didn't mean anything by it, and revert to the ol' "some of my best friends are gay" defense. Danielle says her best friend is actually gay, and she found it offensive. Andy, who is gay, jumps on Danielle's side: "I'm not saying your husband is homophobic, I'm saying I think it was offensive." Teresa says that the night the episode aired, a gay friend was watching it at their house: "He was cracking up. He's like, whoever takes offense at that, he's stupid ... But that's what he said to me. And he's very gay."

This remake of the beloved B-flick from 1976 (which played at Park Hill's Crest Theater) gained a sad measure of posthumous publicity with the death of Whitney Houston, who plays mother to three girls who have a shot at music's big time. With lines like, "Was my life not enough of a cautionary tale for you?" the trailer may be one of the most tragically resonant ever. (Aug. 17, not yet rated)
The concepts of composing and conducting established, it was time for the main event of the afternoon: "The Composer is Dead," by Lemony Snicket and Nathaniel Stookey. Snicket is, of course, best known for his "A Series of Unfortunate Events" books.

Much of the debate is partisan posturing, but it also involves a difficult economic question.

That's what Wainwright is seeking.
If people who have written anti-single-payer comments actually knew about the excellent level of quality health care available in Norway, the second most expensive health system in the world, they wouldn't have written those comments.

Essentially, the film follows Suu Kyi's long journey to help win truly free elections for the Burmese, the years she spent under house arrest as a result, her message of nonviolence in the face of a violently repressive regime, and the sacrifices her political passions required of her family. With a story that singular and that inspiring, it's easy to see what attracted the director, the screenwriter Rebecca Frayn and the film's stars, Michelle Yeoh ("Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon") as Suu Kyi and wonderful British character actor David Thewlis as her husband, Michael Aris. (He also fills in as Aris' twin, Anthony, with a slightly altered comb-over expected to distinguish between the two that doesn't work on any number of levels.)

After Sweeney’s second meeting with Christie, early in the evening, a group of Republican senators spoke with the governor and Kwon about pulling out before the vote.
A station that won't approve fraudulent advertisements for products should be at least as vigilant about misleading political advertisements. And in most cases the work will already have been done for them by organizations such as FactCheck.org. Super PACs and other political groups would be more responsible in framing their messages if they knew they had to pass a truth test to get them on the air.
"To be honest with you, I don't know. And that's probably one of the reasons why I became a lawyer and not a doctor, or an engineer, or a scientist — because I can't figure this stuff out," Christie said. "But I would say at this point, that has to be proven, and I'm a little skeptical about it."

"The Hunger Games" is based on the first book in a young adult trilogy by Suzanne Collins -- although like "Harry Potter," its popularity has long since spread beyond the braces-and-pimples set. And like "Harry Potter," this is a series in which the writer's world is so singular that it requires utmost fidelity in its transition to the big screen -- if only for the continued personal safety of the director and screenwriter.

Any plastic bags that aren't reused at home can be returned to stores for recycling. A state law passed recently requires large grocers and retailers to offer recycling bins so we can bring back plastic grocery bags -- plus dry-cleaning film, this newspaper's delivery bag and plastic wraps from bread, paper towels and more -- to be recycled into other products. These products get another life as durable backyard decking, home building products, city park benches and new plastic bags.

Cabrera's range decreased last year at short in the second half.

Nick Provo, Syracuse, TE: Provo was projected as a fifth or sixth-round pick so it was a little surprising that the Ravens were able to get him as a undrafted free agent. Provo, who is 6-foot-3, 250 pounds, had 51 catches for 537 yards and nine touchdowns in his Syracuse career. He is a smart player with good hands though his ability to make the Ravens will likely depend on how much improvement he shows as a blocker. The Ravens already have two receiving tight ends and they need a good blocker at the No.3 tight end spot.

The axis of Koi's menu is a choice of four meats, prepared in the style of Korean barbecue: cut into thin slices, marinated and grilled. Choose your flavor -- spicy pork, spicy chicken, Korean short ribs or bul-go-gi -- and your method: tacos (mingled with sour cabbage and cilantro -- a wow at $2); burritos fat with Spanish rice (a good change from the usual meat-bean model, $6); or as surprisingly good sliders with cheese. It's hard to tell the meats apart, but they're all good. The real fun is the condiments: taste-bud-boggling kimchi and homemade tomatillo sauce blissfully pounded with Korean hot peppers.

To stuff the turkey, plan on 3/4 to 1 cup of prepared stuffing per pound of bird. Prepare the stuffing separately, and do not stuff ahead of time, which risks bacterial growth. Don't pack the stuffing into the cavity too tightly. The stuffing will absorb juices from the roasting bird, so it needs room to expand. You can bake stuffing separately in a casserole dish -- many cooks prefer it -- but remember that it will not take as long to cook as the turkey.

Next, I shall surprise you by citing as a favorable factor the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, which with various affiliated organizations pretty much controls the commercial development of the region. It seems to me that the economic situation out here has forced it, perhaps unconsciously, to acquire a profounder notion of its responsibilities than you will find in most organizations of its kind. The average American chamber of commerce, in my experience with it, is a noisy, tiresome, and exceedingly childish booster affair, with no maturer idea of its function than to bring as many factories'to town as possible, in order that merchants will have more customers, realtors more prospects for their lots, and property more benefit from the unearned increment. That, and a running wrangle with the Interstate Commerce Commission, carried on by the traffic department, over some freight differential enjoyed by a nearby city, is about the extent of its activity. As to whether the factories are desirable, as to whether abolishment of the differential would throw several railroads into bankruptcy, they seldom give a thought; and sometimes, as when one Eastern city proudly announced the advent of a soap factory that had stunk so badly it was run out of another city, you wonder whether they are quite bright.

New research shows that only one-quarter of America's 52 million K-12 students perform on par with the average performance of the world's five best school systems -- which are now in Singapore, Hong Kong, Finland, Taiwan and South Korea. Even worse is U.S. performance in advanced achievement in math and science, the best predictor of the engineering and scientific prowess that will drive future growth. Sixteen countries produce at least twice the percentage of advanced math students we do, according to research from Harvard and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The United States spends more on schools than most wealthy nations as a share of GDP yet ranks in the middle to the bottom of the pack on international comparisons. McKinsey estimates that the cost of this achievement gap vs. other nations is up to $2 trillion a year -- the equivalent of a permanent national recession.

Lady Gaga enlisted Clarence Clemons, the Big Man himself, to play on "Hair" and "The Edge of Glory."

What sets Gialina pizza apart is the handmade crust, with puffy edges that are darkened but not blistered and a delicately chewy texture - it's nearly cracker-crisp on the outside, giving way to that elusive tender breadiness. The secret, according to Ardiana, is a low yeast-to-flour ratio and a dough that is wetter than most. She also makes the dough the night before so it has time to proof.
If not for running out of bounds to stop the clock in regulation and fumbling in overtime, Marion Barber would have been a hero last week. He rushed for 108 yards and a nine-yard touchdown and made a diving catch for a 16-yard gain in OT. The Bears figure to attack a Seahawks run defense ranked 11th in the NFL, not only with Barber but with a heavier dose of Kahlil Bell (13 carries, 74 yards in his last two games). Caleb Hanie's mobility looked like it might be a weapon after he rushed for 50 yards on 5 carries vs. the Raiders. But Hanie has had just three rushes for 14 yards in two games since then.

When Demes left, Couvron was at or near the top of Portland's restaurant heap. During eight years in Portland, the restaurant, in a low-slung building above Lincoln High School now home to Kinara Thai Bistro, garnered accolades including four Mobil Guide stars, four AAA diamonds and six Wine Spectator awards of excellence. Customers crammed into the dining room's 32-seat restaurant for its four-hour meals, highlighted by Demes' towering presentations.
A character known as "Big Block Bruce" in Ohio found two Chevrolet engines manufactured within a week of each other in July 1966, and those went into the boat. The company that manufactured the vinyl located the original dies for vinyl used on the Rivas, and they retooled some machines to make vinyl for this project — with exactly the correct grain. So the boat has coverings that match the originals.

Allen has exhausted his appeals in the case, and a review of DNA evidence in 2003 and 2010 was inconclusive. Seminal fluid was found at the scene, but DNA tests showed it was not his.

After struggling throughout his pro career as a former No. 1 overall draft pick, 49ers quarterback Alex Smith has shined with Harbaugh, a former NFL quarterback, in charge.

In his last two games, a new more aggressive Darius Conley has emerged as he set personal career highs of 20 points against Minnesota and 23 points against LIU while maintaining his steady field goal percentage from the floor of 48 percent.

He has also become more of a defensive force at the same time, blocking eight shots in the last two games.

What is most impressive is that he has made this transformation without turning his back on any of the "Wrecking Ball" material. Instead, he has channeled the energy of the classic material to the new stuff -- and he is making it all hum and crackle. The Boss continues to stand proudly behind his recent work: Once again, he played eight of the eleven songs on "Wrecking Ball." But rather than dwell on the album's themes of economic hardship, Springsteen has seized on the thread of resurrection that runs through the new set. In rock and roll, the Boss is born again hard, howling out a final, glorious stand against his twin foes: time and mortality.

Next let's address aesthetics. Not to sound cliché, but the sky is the limit when it comes to constructing your raised garden bed. Options can be as simple as a kit that comes with everything you need to build your own. Once you have an idea of how you want to build your raised bed, it is time to pick out your materials.

* New Orleans over Minnesota tonight as the NFL kicks off the 2010 season. Defending Super Bowl champs haven't done well in terms of repeating -- the last time it happened was the 2005 New England team -- but they usually come out strong, having won the last six season-openers in the Thursday-night showcase. Two other factors: the Saints are at home. The Saints also figure to pound Brett Favre again. The gradual beating took a toll on Favre in last season's NFC Championship Game; in the second half Favre threw two INTs and had a passer rating of 54.8. In the first half of that game, Favre had a TD with no INTs and a rating of 83.3.One of this years, Favre will be physically diminished. Is it this year?

The first quarter is a seasonally weak one for contract-based plans, and the industry is likely to show some subscriber additions for the whole of the year. But the gains will be spread unevenly over the phone companies. For the last year and half, the four nationwide phone companies have added or lost subscribers in order of size: Verizon Wireless, the largest, has gained the most, followed by AT&T Inc. Sprint Nextel Corp., No. 3 in size, has mostly lost subscribers, while No. 4 T-Mobile has done so consistently. That poses a conundrum for regulators who want to preserve vibrant competition in the industry.

There are songs that I look up and see what's popular so more people will look at the video, and that's the most obvious way. I do a lot of songs that I really like, like Ryan Adams. I was feeling lonely on the road, missing my mom a lot, so I covered "Oh My Sweet Carolina," and that's about missing your family. I felt really connected to that song. [Covers] make me like the artist more. I've never been a huge Taylor Swift fan, not because she's not talented but it's just never been my thing. Listening and playing a lot of her songs, I've been thinking she's a very good songwriter. I'm thinking about doing a Dawes cover sometime because they're not as popular as they should be.

Long dubbed "the world's oldest teenager" because of his boyish appearance, Clark bridged the rebellious new music scene and traditional show business, and equally comfortable whether chatting about music with Sam Cooke or bantering with Ed McMahon about TV bloopers.

This notion of basing a wine competition on regional identity isn't novel, but the sense it makes looks to be expanding in appeal to even much larger judgings. Thus, even some international competitions that get thousands of entries have begun to restructure themselves to base the evaluation of wines by place of origin as well as by the more traditional standards of varietal and style.

The two sides are now in mediation. If those talks break down either side could request the creation of a three-member panel that would review the final offers of both sides. That process would take over 75 days to complete.
Also, the company is still working on tools for editing the photos, so, for now, you can't do common things like cropping, or changing brightness or contrast. The camera lacks a flash, though this is partly offset by its unusually large f/2 lens, which is always fully open, letting in a lot of available light, even when zoomed. Also, the camera doesn't come with a charger. You have to charge it, slowly, by plugging it into a computer, or, more rapidly, by using one of a list of approved chargers from other devices, such as an iPhone charger.

The names on the plaques mirror basketball's incremental rise in popularity. They move from modest fame (no high Q scores here) — Naismith, Allen, Mikan, Wooden (as a player), Kurland, Russell (John D.) — to those easily recognized by the casual basketball fan — Auerbach, Cousy, Wooden (as a coach), Russell (Bill), Chamberlain, West, Baylor, Robertson, Reed, Maravich, Erving. The spotlight then shifts to names easily recognized by the casual sports fan — Abdul-Jabbar, Bird, Johnson, Thomas, Barkley, Ewing, Olajuwon, Jackson — and finally rests on one that has managed to transcend basketball and become an institution of popular culture — Jordan. The Honors Ring is markedly incomplete, however. A large swath of white space eagerly awaits another fifty some-odd years of basketball history.
Folks line up for Bakesale Betty's (www.bakesalebetty.com), then grab a seat at one of the ironing boards — no tables here — on the sidewalk to chow down on massive fried chicken sandwiches or luscious strawberry shortcakes.

"The Dictator": You basically need to know three things about this comedy: 1) It stars Sacha Baron Cohen and is helmed by Larry Charles, the pair who unleashed the outrageousness of "Borat" upon the world; 2) It's about the title despot, who has a Gadhafi-esque penchant for grandiose uniforms and enough money to win actress Megan Fox (who's shown in the preview complaining of his gift of a ruby, "What am I, a Kardashian?"); 3) Cohen appeared in costume at the Oscars and disrupted the smiling and posing by dumping Kim Jong-Il's "ashes" on Ryan Seacrest. Still not offended? Then you're probably going to love it. (May 16)

For many decades Mexico experienced severe economic crises periodically. The last one to decimate its citizens' wallets occurred in 1995. Since then, my country has enjoyed economic stability and, despite the 2008-09 worldwide recession, its economic and social indicators have maintained a positive trend. As a result, Mexico has become the 14th largest economy in the world, a middle-income country with a per-capita GDP of $14,610.
“I love the format, the format's awesome,” White said. “As far as the show goes, it's a home run for FX. It's on Friday nights. Friday nights they do movies and reruns. We're the No. 1 thing in males 18-34 every Friday night. If not we're No. 2 if they pull something off that beats us. For me, I want to pull three million viewers on FX.”

The quality of Wallace's county work was not an issue, according to the suit. One week after being fired, Wallace received the Wayne County Achievement Award.
Now, I can choose to try to make all of my worship spontaneous - every piece of it some completely new creation. I can make up my own song, say my own prayer, dance my own dance. It won't be pretty, but I can do it. But in my experience there's often great power in participating in what someone else has created. For me, liturgy is being a participant in the art of worship - both offered up to God, and shaping us as we experience it. It's not the whole of my spiritual life (I do pray "my own" prayers, of course) but it's a meaningful component of it.
Under the direction of Martin Friedman, the three principal actors, although good individually, don't display the crisp ensemble timing required. Robert Hawkes as Smith is best when growling out threats but less interesting when he's immersed in his greedy scheme. Anne McEvoy's sniffling Bernstein is pathetic and adorable. And Andrew Narten is elegantly amoral as the lawyer, although one wishes his part were written with more heft.
OBAMA: "On the day I took office, our auto industry was on the verge of collapse. Some even said we should let it die. With a million jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen. In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We got workers and automakers to settle their differences. We got the industry to retool and restructure. Today, General Motors is back on top as the world's No. 1 automaker. Chrysler has grown faster in the U.S. than any major car company. Ford is investing billions in U.S. plants and factories. And together, the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs. We bet on American workers. We bet on American ingenuity. And tonight, the American auto industry is back."  Jan. 24 State of the Union speech.

That information like this was not widely known until recently was, in part, a testament to the effectiveness of the global warming alarmists in suppressing the publication of dissenting opinion. But that suppression was exposed in the 2009 "Climategate" scandal, and the dialogue on climate change then improved drastically.
That's why every Wednesday, Upshaw drives an hour to meet Debbie Deutsch at Gunn High School in Palo Alto. Deutsch, who is 51 and lives in Los Altos, ran track at Rutgers, but gave it up when she started a career and a family. She knew "Coach Joy" because their daughters are the same age and run track. Deutsch also has two sons who pole-vault, and after watching enough meets, "I called Joy when I was 49 and said, 'I want to start running Masters track, and I'd like to train with you."

Back to the defense, the Capitals sucked the excitement out of what the NHL and NBC had hoped would be another marquee matchup between Crosby and Alex Ovechkin. They played the kind of no-nonsense hockey that gets it done in the playoffs, stifling Jordan Staal and the Penguins offense by building a barricade in front of Neuvirth, who could have tended goal in a folding chair.
"If nothing else from today’s meeting we should be assured of the fact that we take these things seriously and the investigation will continue, and in much more depth," said Commissioner Joseph Fiordaliso.

It's a mutant, but it is quite beautiful. Is there any way I can reproduce it? How? Should I save the pollen? (I used to help my grandfather cross-pollinate, but that was almost 40 years ago, and I was a little kid.) Oh, and my husband cut it today to take to his mum at the board and care.

"It is no accident that as the campus has become more diverse, our students are becoming more successful," said David McDonald, associate provost at Western, in a prepared statement.
Part of that is the obvious athleticism, led by Cunningham. The group is athletic and deep enough that it already has reinvented its identity. No longer will the Beavers be that team that runs the 1-3-1 – after running 80 percent zone last season, Robinson said, it will play man-to-man defense about 70 percent of the time in 2011-12.

That's what will be determined over the next few months.

Then I got the chance to play at UCLA and went to law school at USC. I began a coaching career at UCLA that took me to Colorado then to Washington and back to UCLA. The launch of the Pac-12 Networks is very exciting and I am thrilled for this opportunity to help deliver unprecedented exposure to the Conference of Champions."

THE looks that designers sent down the men's spring runways in Milan and Paris won't hit the racks until next year. But if you live in Southern California, you've already seen them — or something like them, as brands from staid Hermès to quirky Viktor & Rolf and everyone in between went California casual, dressing down and making it clear that the Golden State's influence on what men wear has expanded far beyond the surf breaks, skate parks and denim bars.

Thursday was the breaking point. My wife, the lucky duck, forced her way out the door and went to the calm confines of work. Added to the mix that day was my 2-year-old godson, Borrowed Bits, whom I normally babysit during the week, but he had spent the last two days holed up with his parents. He was so happy to see my boys that he was the least of my problems.

What's cool about it: "Smile" isn't just a "lost" album, it's a kind of existential one. No one (not even its creators) can tell you exactly what its official version should consist of.

This set, made for true B.B. maniacs, will further complicate its strange history - which, naturally, will only add to its myth.

In many ways, âThe Avengersâ feels like the truest adaptation of the original comics to the motion picture screen. It doesnât mythologize or minimize or condescend or get lost in fanboy minutiae. Instead, it plays up the clash of personalities â and the simple act of acknowledging that superheroes can actually have personalities may be its boldest move â while never skimping on the popcorn thrills. It gives superhero movies, and even summer movies in general, a good name.
For a true home theater experience, don’t forget to invest in a pair (or a few pairs) of blackout curtains. These look just like standard window coverings, but they’re lined so they block out most, if not all, of the light outside -- which makes it easy to darken your room any time of day. Add a cozy blanket, popcorn and soda to complete the experience.

* After winning the World Series for the third time, Tony La Russa retired as Cardinals' manager to cap a brilliant 35-season career in the dugout. MLB Commissioner Bud Selig has asked La Russa to manage the National League squad in the 2012 All-Star Game. It was a classy and appropriate invitation by Selig. And TLR quickly accepted. La Russa is one of the greatest managers in MLB history, and his retirement came suddenly and rather unexpectedly. There was no "Farewell Tour," no send-off. The All-Star Game will at least give La Russa a chance to take a bow. Fans and baseball people will get a chance, if ever so briefly, to formally salute La Russa's career. And that's good.

You saw my house, right?"

Job No. 1 is improving energy efficiency. Enormous waste is embedded in our buildings, homes and factories. Over the next 10 years, we can replace and remodel old, inefficient machines and equipment and make all new buildings completely energy efficient.

Smart distribution grids could generate zero-emission and high-efficiency power and integrate wind and solar at low cost. All of the new demand for electricity could be met by increasing efficiency.

In reverse of a no-hitter, where success builds, each failure of a declining player seems to beget another failure. Free of major injury, Abbott sees his fastball desert him, and it is as if the strapping pitcher has been cursed all over again. Did too many cutters take their toll on his arm?

Which is good because Bennett, who was brilliant in relief of Darron Thomas a season ago, is locked into what appears to be a prolonged battle to become UO's starting quarterback. Normally, after such a favorable cameo and Thomas' early departure, Bennett would be the obvious successor. But Chip Kelly is intrigued by redshirt freshman Marcus Mariota, who is said to be dead even with Bennett. And if Kelly is intrigued, consider the Ducks' faithful ultra-curious, especially since it would seem to suggest the unknown (Mariota) might represent an upgrade over the known, even if Bennett barely has enough tape to prompt any meaningful conclusion on how he projects as the starter.

"At the beginning of the year the team really wasn't clicking," senior third baseman Luke Turner said. "We were kind of playing as individuals.

Americans might be tempted to equate Radio 4 with National Public Radio, which is also lauded for its high-quality programs, but that would be incorrect, Goddard and other analysts say. Radio 4's variety eclipses that of NPR. So does its influence on British society and public life. The "Today" morning news program on Radio 4 often sets the day's national political agenda in a way that NPR's "Morning Edition" does not.

Smith certainly looks the part of an NFL tight end at 6-foot-6 and 255 pounds. He might not be the fastest guy on the field, but he gets around just fine. And, he has really soft hands. Smith was able to easily handle a number of throws during the weekend of practices and gave no indication that he hasn't been at this for very long.
None of that happened. In 1991, Lidstrom was the seventh defenseman on Sweden's Canada Cup team. Even his own coaches did not realize what they had. Then a teammate got hurt, the Swedes were sputtering on the power play, and ... well, why not? They put that Lidstrom kid on the power play.

The Stumptown deal could have been a traditional one in that TSG invested a certain amount and received a corresponding equity stake.

The phrase—battling everything—could have been the mantra for Game of Thrones’ second season on screen and off. Based on New Mexico novelist George R.R. Martin’s fantasy-book series A Song of Ice and Fire, Game of Thrones follows the brutal quest for power among several ruling families in a sprawling mythical kingdom. Its initial 10-episode series order was considered a risky move for a premium network best known for contemporary shows like The Sopranos and Sex and the City. Though the sexy vampire drama True Blood proved that a supernatural series could succeed on the network, the high-fantasy genre was still considered so...so...nerdy. Television’s last hit fantasy series was the syndicated Xena: Warrior Princess, and no TV show had ever pulled off combining swords, sorcery, and R-rated sex and violence. When Thrones premiered to lavish critical praise last April, the network granted it a quick renewal. “Our biggest goal is passionate engagement,” says HBO programming chief Michael Lombardo. “And Thrones has rabidly passionate viewers.” But only about 2.2 million people tuned in for the initial airing, which isn’t so hot when a network spends a reported $50–60 million on a project. Then something strange happened. Fueled by word-of-mouth buzz, Thrones’ ratings went up. And up. Martin’s novels leaped onto best-seller lists, moving a staggering 8.4 million copies in 2011, including his newest Song of Ice and Fire installment, A Dance With Dragons.

In fact, Detroit documentaries have become such a prevalent phenomenon that the Changing Gears website ran a tongue-in-cheek guide to making one.

Young white people who want to rebuild Detroit are totally in right now."
Perhaps that's why the play avoids the pitfalls that plague translations on stage. Although Boehm has lived in Poland, he's an American.

I remember the first time I went to La Habra. I had just become editor for northeast O.C. I'd been told we had a reporter based in La Habra. One day I went to visit. He was working out of a former newspaper building our company still owned, the old La Habra Star on Palm. I pulled into the parking lot. Not another car in it. Weeds grew through the cracks in the asphalt. No sign of any lights on inside. Couldn't be the place. I tried the front door. Locked. I walked around to the side and along a long block wall I found a metal door propped open an inch. I stepped in.

Russo and his willing confederates deserve whatever punishment they receive from the federal courts. But they leave behind much collateral damage that can be repaired only through an end to the virtual one-party rule by Cuyahoga County Democrats that enabled Russo and his cronies to thwart any realistic checks and balances for so long, and an even more diligent house-cleaning of county government than the one already under way as part of charter reforms voters enacted last year.
Mayor Jerry Fried said he wanted to introduce the ordinance early to spark a discussion.

It's not that simple, of course. In overwhelmingly Democratic Cuyahoga County, few Republicans have a chance in a countywide election. Consequently, the county GOP usually offered the three only tacit opposition, and sometimes none at all.

And that will continue. Expect the Buckeyes to go to their bench for any real significant playing time -- other than Sam Thompson sharing the two-guard sport with Lenzelle Smith Jr. -- only during blowouts in the tournament or in cases of foul trouble.

The movie — which received an A, according to CinemaScore — was also released abroad in 84 foreign countries this past weekend, grossing $35.5 million. Fox, which is releasing the film internationally, is hopeful that the movie will be a hit abroad, because theaters were sparse in many countries when the original debuted 15 years ago. For instance, when "Titanic" opened in Russia in 1998, it played in only 32 theaters and grossed $5.1 million. By comparison, "Titanic 3-D" was screened in 10 times as many Russian locations and made $4.9 million — 97% of the original's lifetime gross in the country. Yet despite the seemingly impressive figure, Russian moviegoers responded more positively to the naughty antics of the "Reunion" guys than "Titanic 3-D," as the comedy sold $5.1 million worth of tickets there.

GLOVE: Domnit Bolivar, UT, Springfield (AA). The righthanded-hitting infielder completed the first cycle in Springfield Cardinals history a week ago, and that's helped raise his line to .276/.290/.483 at Class AA. The 22-year-old Venezuelan was one of the early international signings for the Cardinals as they re-established their presence in the Caribbean. Originally, the Cardinals planted him in Palm Beach as a utility guy who didn't play shortstop. The reasoning was the Cardinals wanted to put an established, even veteran, glove at shortstop to help a young, prospect-laden pitching staff. This was a priority for the Cardinals because if they wanted Miller and Kelly and others to embrace the power of the groundball the club needed an infielder who could, you know, turn those groundballs into outs. The Cardinals' first pick for that job faltered, and now Bolivar has emerged, though he's followed Miller and Maikel Cleto to Double-A. Bolivar stepped in for shortstop Ryan Jackson last weekend and had his cycle, but he also proved that he could play the position. The Cardinals aren't looking for a prospect they can project; they are looking for a glove they can trust. Bolivar could become that organizational soldier. Bolivar has, as farm director John Vuch said, "enhanced his value to us. He's helped his long-term value here by showing he can play solid enough shortstop."

In 1958, the court said: "The (Eighth) Amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society." Justice Antonin Scalia has warned: "A society that adopts a bill of rights is skeptical that ‘evolving standards of decency' always ‘mark progress,' and that societies always ‘mature,' as opposed to rot."

One positive to the Angels' power move for Pujols is that it gave Cardinals' management the kind of payroll flexibility the franchise hasn't had for years.

The food at Agave Grill is great, but it's the small touches that add flair to the dishes and make the restaurant noteworthy. The chips and salsa are both made on site, as are the tortillas. When the basket of chips arrives at your table don't be surprised if they're still warm and doughy. They were probably just pulled out of the fryer and sprinkled with chipotle seasoning. The salsa is bright and filled with chunky pieces of tomatoes, onions and peppers. Do you like it hot? Just ask for something spicier and you'll be given two choices: roasted serrano or habanero salsa. Be sure to use the chips as a scoop while you devour the shrimp cocktail, which is more like ceviche.

Learning isn't just about the memorization of facts. Teachers understand - and you probably do as well if you remember your greatest classroom experiences - that discussion, collaboration and working on projects together as a class can have a huge impact on student learning.

Collaborative problem solving, socialization and working with other people are key to getting along in life. That's much more difficult to achieve in an online environment.

It wasn't a riff on Thai duck curry, a fantasy on a theme of Thai duck curry or a chiefly re-imagining of Thai duck curry — it was a Thai duck curry, and a pretty good one.

The sleds travel a few kilometers, and riders can then take a taxi back up the hill or down to Funchal. For the not-so-adventurous, it's still worth the trip up to Monte – and the extra few euros to take the cable car back down.

Their friends and fans wouldn't expect to find their work in museums or traditional galleries circa 1970. But there were exceptions, with cutting-edge exhibits at the de Saisset Art Gallery at Santa Clara University and the then-new Berkeley Art Museum and Oakland Museum.

I reported a column recently that featured the longtime struggles in football at Parkrose High School. It's a program that didn't win a single league game over a 12-year span, but the kids there are so determined, they refuse to quit. I noted in reporting the piece that children too often look for reasons to give up. Adults, too. And it feels more and more like hope and faith are too often lost in the exchange of everyday life.
Now a sponsor of the most recent marriage-equality bill introduced last week, the Democrat from West Deptford Township says he’s already received some heat from more conservative constituents.
The Lions withstood the urge to move up in the third round after a handful of defensive backs went off the board early. When Bentley was there at No. 85, they jumped at the chance to land the small-school playmaker who should contribute immediately at cornerback.
Bley knows a little about preaching. She grew up in East Oakland, just a few blocks from where the Oakland-Alameda Country Coliseum and Oracle Arena stand today. Her father was a piano teacher, and she started playing piano when she was three or four years old. Performing came quickly. "I was a professional," she recalled with a laugh. "I was going around to church meetings and singing 'This Little Light of Mine' and holding my hand out and getting money to give to my parents. And that was not my own idea; that was my parents' idea. I was like a little monkey."
"We had already started talking about either going of town or dismantling this place. One way or another, we had to get back to $100 million," Payne said. "For us, it was out-of-town."
Among examples cited are an inmate whose pleas for help were ignored for two years while cancer swelled his liver to four times its normal size and then killed him; a four-months pregnant woman who was told her problems were "all in your head" and was left alone in a cell while she miscarried; at least two examples of inmate suicides that poorly trained staff failed to prevent; an inmate punished for using CPR to save another inmate after a heart attack while corrections officers refused to summon medical help; and many examples of prisoners waiting months and even years for treatment of fractured bones, broken teeth and other medical issues.

Opponents held huge protests outside the Statehouse as SB 5 was debated and, once it was passed, collected a record 1.3 million signatures to put the law before voters. The effort included more than 3,000 volunteers, said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern. Backed largely by unions, the anti-SB 5 coalition We Are Ohio raised more than $30 million for the fight -- a figure that dwarfed most recent numbers reported by the bill's supporters.

TURNING POINT
Treasurer Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff acknowledged in an interview that while the governor had not yet tackled some of the major underlying costs that made up the $11 billion deficit he dealt with in the budget passed last month, Christie would be asking the Legislature to address the "underlying drivers" of spending."It’s unfair to all stakeholders ... to maintain the fiction that we can return to the halcyon days," he said. "Because we can't do it and we won't do it."
That something turned out to be marzipan, a paste made from ground almonds and sugar. It's sold in the baking aisle of just about every grocer and has a soft, putty-like consistency and a deliciously sweet-almondy flavor. It's easy to form into balls and is perfect for coating with chocolate.

Pernetti is the salesman now, and where Rutgers lands will be his legacy. He’s not off to a great start.

But the Civil War wasn't romantic. It cost 620,000 American lives, more than this country's other wars combined, from the Revolution through Vietnam. That was about 2% of the population; if it happened now, historians estimate, the equivalent number of dead would total 6 million.
Each part of the ceremony will be as hotly anticipated as the last (and really what other event has people just as excited for the advertising as for the main attraction?). And all of it will be accompanied, in many places, by eucharistic feasts of comfort food that are second to none.

A Social Intelligence report to a company would include racist remarks, sexually explicit photos or videos, or flagrant displays of weapons or illegal activity, Mr. Drucker says. And your decision to post a naked picture of yourself might not go over well with a potential employer. "That might not be relevant to the job, but an employer gets to determine if that's the kind of person he wants representing his company," Mr. Drucker says. "We don't make the decisions. We just generate the reports."

Wynne helped popularize the concept of paying one admission fee, while other parks at the time charged visitors to go on individual rides. And he created a corporate culture where no employee - from ride operators to the CEO - could walk past a piece of trash and not pick it up and throw it away. It's an ethos that still exists today; whenever Roemer is out in the park, he carries a broom and pan with him, sweeping up any litter he sees.

On Tuesday, like in a Hollywood epic, the Loire River swarmed with wooden boats filled with locals dressed in medieval garb — re-enacting Joan of Arc's legendary entry into the city in 1429.
Here's what I like already. There seem to be just as many "buts" in the CVC's current offers as "yesses." In the original deal, the city, county and state negotiators just said "yes" to everything that Rams president John Shaw asked for. St. Louis negotiated from a stance of desperation the first time, which is how Shaw was able to stick in so many incredible clauses in this lease in the first place. As one person close to those original negotiations told me a few years ago, "We kept waiting for someone to say, 'OK, we'll agree to that, BUT you have to give us this … ' And the 'but' never came."

Kirkpatrick has everything one could ask from a cornerback – size (6-1½, 186 pounds), speed (timed in the 4.4s at his pro day after a rough overall showing at the Scouting Combine), physicality, good ball skills and a confident attitude – which means he might get nowhere near the Giants’ pick. Nearly every mock draft has him going in the late teens to early 20s, which means the Giants will have to move up if they want to land Kirkpatrick.

Last year, chef Nei' opened a less expensive place called Flying Pan Bistro on Clay Street just east of Kearny. It didn't fly, so he moved Jai Yun there, almost tripling the space of the original.

In their time, the daughters of the second Baron Redesdale, better known as the Mitford sisters, were an industry. Their trade, for the most part, was their mere existence — swanning about British society, leaving scandal and newsprint in their wake. Nancy wrote deliciously acidic novels and gossipy history. (Evelyn Waugh dedicated "The Loved One" to her.) Diana and Unity were avowed fascists. Adolf Hitler was a witness at Diana's wedding to Oswald Mosely, and Unity was so besotted with the Führer and chagrined when Britain declared war on Germany that she tried to kill herself. Deborah and Pamela were more reserved, but the tabloids avidly detailed all the sisters' fashions, marriages, politics and real estate.

We hear gentle janglings of percussion and soft peek-a-boo gestures from the winds: Life is emerging inside a big teeming organism, represented by the orchestra, which Adams sets to shimmering and pulsing.

Rangers defenseman Michael Del Zotto coughed up the puck in the neutral zone, letting Johansson leave a drop pass for Jeff Halpern. As Halpern took a shot from the top of the right faceoff circle, Johansson went to the front of the net; when Rangers backup goaltender Martin Biron (19 saves) gave up a rebound the second-year center was there to shoot it into an open net. It gave Washington a 1-0 lead 8:18 into the first period and marked Johansson's first goal in 21 games.

Maryland already has a progressive tax structure, and I never spoke out against that structure. It is fair to have a debate about the best rates within that tax structure. But what transpired on the floor of the Senate went far beyond an economic debate and policy question. In an attempt to "stick it" to the high-earners, the Senate didn't just adopt a new rate. The Senate adopted a provision, for the first time in Maryland's history, where the tax on high-earners would be applied to every dollar they earn, unlike every other tax bracket. The effect of that provision would be that an individual making $500,001 would pay close to double the tax of an individual paying $500,000. One dollar more in earnings costs close to $3,000 in taxes. That, of course, makes no sense, which is why the Baltimore Sun, in its editorial "Tax policy on the fly" (March 19), roundly criticized that same provision. But in Mr. Rodricks' world of inflexible party-first politics, does it not matter whether something makes sense at all?

Making health care more accessible and affordable are clearly shared goals that everyone can agree with. But reaching a consensus that the majority of the American people can support is equally vital. President Obama’s health care law has already been struck down by the court of public opinion. It is too intrusive into the lives of every South Jersey resident and too burdensome to our employers who want to do right by their employees without bankrupting their business. It inserts Washington bureaucrats in-between doctors and patients. And it grants the federal government unprecedented and unconstitutional powers over the American people. It is time for the Supreme Court to strike down the president’s health care law.

Corrections officials say this is needed to protect other prisoners from gangsters and to prevent "shot-calling," the passing of orders from imprisoned gang leaders to members. Prisons spokesman Jeffrey Callison says the policy is under review, and a proposed revision would let well-behaved prisoners out of solitary after four years instead of six. But that's still an incredibly long period to serve in solitary confinement, which is often mentally destabilizing.

Rosenbaum used her in the designated player spot, so to not disrupt her defense without a practice. The move paid off as the Stanners were nearly flawless behind starter Victoria Goldbach. The only miscue was a misplayed ball in center on a Maggie Aguirre single that led to the No. 8 Terriers’ (4-2) first run in the bottom of the sixth. Briana Emanuele drove in the other in the frame to make it 6-2.
The unruffled impression Gilbert makes seems rooted in a bedrock of certainty about what matters to him artistically. Asked once to name the single composer whose work he'd choose to take to a desert island, he instantly cited Joseph Haydn.

The decision noted that wheat exports had fallen sharply since the 1920s, resulting in a "large surplus in production." But it didn't take into account that the surplus existed largely because the Roosevelt administration had driven the price of U.S. wheat to almost three times the world market price. FDR and company assumed that high crop prices would somehow make America rich, or at least spur a national recovery during the Depression.

With new Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai at its helm, the Japanese electronics company said Tuesday that it expected an additional tax expense of $3.78 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter that ended March 30. It said this non-cash charge stemmed from revaluing U.S. tax credits that are unlikely to be used because of its string of annual losses.
“I’m proud of them. You don’t always need your ‘A’ game to feel good about a win. We just have to continue to try to get some maturity and show up in the first inning instead of waiting until we get behind.”
An appeal to the state Employee Relations Board would be limited. Under state statute, the three-member panel cannot determine whether the arbitrator made the right decision. Instead, the board must decide whether there are any grounds for an appeal -- for example, did the arbitrator consider all pertinent evidence, exceed her power, base the ruling on a material mistake, or did the ruling violate public policy or law?
Hollaback! is most welcome to lead a fight for etiquette and against criminal sexual deviance, collecting whatever reports it likes from the public and posting whatever pictures it wants, bearing the risk of the victimization and liability that unfounded postings can produce.

A: For me, it's casting. I think Joel is a guy you empathize with. I think there's a sadness to him. One thing I didn't want to do was make a character that you pitied. I just wanted somebody you could identify with. Vigilante movies always have it where there's a gratuitous rape, and then the guy goes out and kills the gang that rapes his family, so you can watch a rape and not feel guilty about it and then watch people get murdered and not feel guilty about it.
On the business side, demand has been so great that both microdistilleries plan to add second production shifts.
In fact, Noir makes it easy to custom-tailor your meal to suit your appetite or pace, or, especially the wines.

Indeed, widespread disease was among the most daunting problems at Gasconade because crowded conditions, inadequate ventilation and an overloaded waste system made infection control impossible. It's fair to ask whether it was more or less humane for a government stray control agency to spare those strays from euthanasia while keeping them indefinitely in conditions of overcrowding and rampant disease.

Things didn't stop there. This year I also planted in the beds some smallish shrubby roses: 'Julia Child,' because I always liked her; 'Knock Out,' because I succumbed to all the hoopla about it (probably deserved hoopla); and 'Hot Cocoa,' which my neighbors Rosemary and Walt gave us in memory of our late dog Hector. These too are all doing well and seem to be black-spot free without any help from me.

“It’s really, really important to me as the principal of the school, to continue to encourage adults in the building, as well as outside the building, be it coaches and be it parents, that if in fact, they know of an incident where their child has been compromised emotionally, and obviously physically, that they must come forward and share that information,” she said.

Outlook _ Record-setting QB Dalton Hewitt, the MCC Player of the Year in 2009, has moved on and is playing baseball at SEMO, leaving the keys to the Golden Griffins' high-scoring air attack to sophomore Brad Woodson. "Working the last four years with Dalton was an awful lot of fun,'' coach Gene Gladstone said. "But I really like what I've seen of Brad, too.'' The coach feels that Snyder (22 catches, 426 yards, 5 TDs) could emerge as one of the area's top wideouts. The Vianney ground game features Green, who combined for nearly 900 rushing-receiving yards and also picked off five passes last year. Green is joined by Gilmore LBs Andy Baker and Matt Guignon as defensive leaders for the Griffins.

The 6-5, 235-pound senior is one of the best tight ends in the area and may be the best all-around player at that position because of his ability to block and factor into the passing game. He had 18 catches for 306 yards this season, an average of 17 yards per reception and two touchdowns.
Like “Blunderbuss,” Norah Jones’ “Little Broken Hearts” is a breakup album. Like Jack White, Jones is angrier and more vulnerable than she has been in a long time. “The Fall,” Jones’ 2009 album, was an aggressive step forward, but didn’t entirely convince; “Broken Hearts” succeeds where its predecessor did not by dispensing with the loud guitar and concentrating on raw, lovelorn, occasional arresting storytelling. “Miriam,” in particular, is Jones at her most direct: She promises to torture and kill a romantic rival. (Sounds like she means it, too.) Producer Danger Mouse, who co-wrote the entire set with Jones, matches the sharp melodies with accompaniment that owes a bit to Tom Waits at his most atmospheric, a bit to Rilo Kiley at its most languorous and strung-out, and a bit to Elvis Costello at his most impressionistic. Very little of the music could be described as jazz, or even jazzy, so longtime fans might see “Broken Hearts” as further proof of the artist’s defection. But Jones is more interesting as a pop star than she ever was as a chanteuse, and it’s nice to see that she’s finally figured out how to get there.

But the opposition now is raising the stakes, even setting up a small round-the-clock demonstration in a Moscow square. That puts Putin in a bind. Either he invites international opprobrium with tough police action or risks allowing the opposition to expand its actions to something resembling the 2004 Orange Revolution tent-camp in Kiev. Putin denounced both the Orange Revolution and the similar Rose Revolution in Georgia — and allowing similar actions in Moscow could be seen as blinking first in a staring match.
In winter 2010, engineers discovered an even bigger problem -- columns on four of the project's tallest bridges had moved out of plumb. Worse, the earth was still moving. The project has been on hold since.
But here's the problem: When police in most suburban communities in America get a 9-1-1 call regarding a suspicious male with a gun, they respond with all due urgency. They determine the threat level before they relax their guard and re-holster their guns. That's appropriate.
"Until euro area policymakers understand that monetary union has intrinsic weaknesses and fragilities embedded in its infrastructure and fail to respond at the system-wide level, periods of financial instability will continue to be a feature," said Jacques Cailloux, European economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland.

I see that injustice and, again, I don't know what the answer is to that. Is the answer to boycott Last Thursday or Alberta? I know some people who have done that in smaller and larger ways.

"NJEA members make these endorsement decisions and they have made it clear that they will not endorse legislators who have impaired their right to collectively bargain and who have imposed thousands of dollars of additional costs on public employees," the union president, Barbara Keshishian, said.

With a saturation of cultural reference, "Solar Dance" conveys the heady atmosphere that made Berlin the first European capital to embrace the transforming potential of art in a secular age. Yet it also created the ideological void that ended in the rise of Hitler. Van Gogh was celebrated as a solitary genius whose paintings rebelled "against the formalism of the establishment" and made "the untamed decorative"; but the potential for fakery in his messy oeuvre, and for embellishment of his biography, risked introducing just the kind of "fantasy world of myth and mastery" that drew people to National Socialism—a process Mr. Eksteins recounts in the final part of the book.

Cleveland Hammonds Jr., who died Tuesday at age 75, possessed such qualities. Mr. Hammonds, a Louisiana native who grew up in Alton, served as superintendent of the city schools from 1996 to 2003, an impossibly long run by today's standards. He was the last of the old-style superintendents, and his tenure offers lessons about the district that still are worth heeding.

The U.S. government has become a giant check-writing machine, with two-thirds of the federal budget given over to payments to individuals  Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment benefits, food stamps, housing subsidies.

Michaels' death also brought an already close family even closer.

Try the ghormeh sabzi — a fascinatingly bitter stew of beef and many, many greens. If the fesenjan is the brash youngster of stews, then this is the thoughtful elder stew, full of long-cooked herbs and the essence of spinach. It has the thoughtful, unfolding bitterness of those old-man habits: cigars and scotches and stouts. High-concept perfumer Christopher Brosius makes a perfume that's supposed to smell like his memory of his grandfather — sawdust and motor oil and sweat and Old Spice and love. There's a kinship between that perfume and this stew.

"Is it disappointing we didn't win more games?" FSU coach Jimbo Fisher asked rhetorically Wednesday morning. "Yes we want to win more games.

Already 235 members of the House of Representatives -- 227 Republicans and eight Democrats -- are co-sponsors of a bill to repeal the tax. Twenty-three Republican senators but no Democratic senators favor repeal. The Democrats who imposed this tax on a single manufacturing sector justified this discrimination by saying Obamacare would be a boon to the medical devices industry because, by expanding insurance coverage, it would stimulate demand for devices. But those insured because of Obamacare will be disproportionately young and not needing, say, artificial knees. And well before Obamacare, the law had long required hospitals to provide devices to the needy who are uninsured.

Desserts have to be really good to be worth $11. What I had didn't measure up, or maybe I was just disappointed that the chocolate and peanut butter sandwich was really like a chocolate-covered mousse with very little nut flavor, arranged on an unfortunate swipe of chocolate, with three small fried chocolate croquettes and a pleasant malted chocolate milk shake.

But in the last half of the 20th century, technology played an ever-greater role in the development of wine. California wineries were the leaders in this in the '70s and '80s, spurring an evolution throughout the world. By expanding the geography of where stable, quality wines could be produced, production increased and costs fell.

To get the bedbugs-are-coming word out, we can think of an even better strategy than surveys of pest-control companies that are then sent to the press. (Newspapers, after all, are so yesterday.) Anyone watch GoatCam? What about a bedbugcam?

I'm not sure where, but your letter gave us all hope. And I'm also sure Ryan Gosling keeps your note with the marriage proposal tucked under his pillow at night. It was, after all, quite moving.

Comment: First-round talent. Closed gap on Blackmon with impressive combine. His time in 40 helped assuage doubt about his straight-line speed. Snatches balls as much as he catches them.

As cadets, you volunteered for service during this time of danger. Some of you have fought in Afghanistan. Many will deploy there. As your Commander-in-Chief, I owe you a mission that is clearly defined, and worthy of your service. That is why, after the Afghan voting was completed, I insisted on a thorough review of our strategy. Let me be clear: there has never been an option before me that called for troop deployments before 2010, so there has been no delay or denial of resources necessary for the conduct of the war. Instead, the review has allowed me ask the hard questions, and to explore all of the different options along with my national security team, our military and civilian leadership in Afghanistan, and with our key partners. Given the stakes involved, I owed the American people - and our troops - no less.

It's just something for politicians or whoever runs the library districts to feel important at the expense of the taxpayers and the general public. What do they think we are, stupid?

First, a new Muppet movie -- "The Muppets" -- opened this weekend and got me to thinking of how many generations (at least two) have come to enjoy Jim Henson's creations. And it's not often I think about muppets.
My best advice: No matter what happens, I stay calm and laid-back because when I'm the hostess I can't get stressed out and let my guests feed off my stress.
TNT analyst and Suns Ring of Honor member Charles Barkley on Nash: "I wish him well. If the Suns sign him, that would be stupid. He's (38) years old and they are not a contender. Even if they won (Tuesday), they are a Number 8 seed. They are not a legit contender. At some point, you have to start rebuilding. I love Steve Nash but at some point you have to start rebuilding for the future. He can still play but they don't need him in Phoenix."
Isaacs analyzed foreclosure and U.S. Census Bureau data to estimate the number of children affected.

Wilms said she interviewed for a job with Media Giant at a Beachwood restaurant along with another woman who answered the ad. The interviewer, who introduced himself as Rod Marshall, told the women the job paid up to $60,000. Wilms said the women were told that to reach the next round of interviews, they needed to perform several unpaid tasks, including selling tickets and collecting donations for a foodbank fundraiser.
The jobs bill could help small businesses invest and grow. It would cut the payroll tax in half for employers, and make it easier for businesses to hire. And it would create jobs, building roads and bridges (if we don't stay on top of our roads and bridges it will cost even more money in the end) while preventing up to 280,000 teachers from being laid off. Who would not want to see more Americans put back to work? Families might be better able to put food on their tables for themselves and their children. Why would anyone not choose to have more teachers available to teach their children? Who in their right state of mind would continue to have the rich get richer and the poor get poorer?

I reflected on Alameda's aversion to change on a recent Sunday night as I dined in one of the newly thriving restaurants on Park Street. It wasn't so long ago that the town's culinary choices were so bereft that the opening of an Applebee's generated long waiting lines for months.
Cannon determined that one of Midei's legal filings was therefore "inaccurate."
Further enhancing Thursday's show will be the unusual but appropriate Christina McPhee abstract short "Salt," made up of scenes of McPhee taken on the Carrizo Plain near San Luis Obispo, through which the San Andreas Fault runs. The soundtrack is "weird, creaking sounds," according to Seid, "taken by microphones buried 2,000 feet below ground by the staff from a California-based seismology laboratory."
The show, created by Seth MacFarlane, who attended the Rhode Island School of Design, pretty accurately depicts a slew of real-life Rhode Island places, including the iconic Van Wickle Gates at Brown University and the Breakers mansion in Newport. It takes generous liberties with others.

"Jersey Shore" stars mingled with the likes of Jake Gyllenhaal, Jack Black, Snoop Dogg, Steve Wonder, and Green Day at Spike TV's 7th annual Video Game Awards Show Saturday night in Los Angeles.

As "The Situation" so succinctly puts it on his Twitter feed, "we big time now."

That's gonna kind of be up to them."

But the movie failed to connect with contemporary audiences in the U.S., in part because the source material had already been picked over by so many admirers that the film felt derivative. Further complicating its chances for success, the film's director, Andrew Stanton, had never made a live-action movie. The studio production and marketing executives guiding the project had limited experience in running movie divisions.

"Unions are not bottomless wells when it comes to resources for this stuff," said former AFL-CIO political director Steve Rosenthal. "As we're forced to wage these fights to defend what we've got, it's a win-win for the other side because they force us to spend a lot of money to plug holes in the dike."
When Cobb and Ariadne make the tremulous and altogether familiar-sounding decision ("No!" "But I've got to!" "But it's too dangerous!" "But it's our only hope!" "OK, but I'm coming with you!") to move down into a fourth dream world, I hoped we might finally be headed for a riot of architectural invention. Instead, we get an odd, desultory cross between downtown Los Angeles circa 1965 and the urban-planning fantasies of the French Modernist architect Le Corbusier. Downtown's 1965 Department of Water and Power building, designed by AC Martin and Partners, has been stretched in Seussian fashion to become a very tall skyscraper; on the horizon, meanwhile, appear dozens if not hundreds of Corbusian, tenement-like towers.

"I don't think readers should make too much of this," Tewari said.

Winning in a good way against Denver clearly involves Bynum and Gasol as the focal point. It'll help minimize the Nuggets running its league-leading 104.12 points averaged in total offense. It'll help the Lakers absorb Metta World Peace's absence because of a six-game suspension stemming from his elbowing last week on Oklahoma City's James Harden.

Me and (Jordan Theodore) have to get our young guys involved early and then try and build off of that. That’s why Coach Willard pulled us aside with 50 seconds in the game and said, ‘We’ve got to figure this out.’ Me and Theo have to be the ones to get those guys better shots.”

I told him the doctor told me I was supposed to be brain dead, so I'm living testimony that it can happen.

Vieira's choreography is deeply rooted in capoeira, the Brazilian martial art that was created by slaves during the 1600s as a way to defend themselves against oppression. The intense movement was disguised as dance as a way to fool slave owners, and since has evolved into a key element of Brazilian cultural identity. The intent of "Ritmos" is to pay homage to the African rhythms that are the foundations of samba and bossa nova music, and there are hints in the movement of the dark oppression experienced by slaves. But much of the movement is an emotionless tangle of arms and legs, with just enough mistakes to make you wonder how many times dancers take a hit in the face while learning their routines.

U.S. economic expansion fueled heavy immigration in the 1990s as Mexicans found jobs in construction, service and other sectors. For instance, Mexicans were instrumental in turning Arizona into a fast-growing state and its capital Phoenix into the country's fifth-largest city. "It is logical that the supply of Mexican labor helped fuel Arizona's growth," said Dennis Hoffman, professor of economics at the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University.

If this offseason hasn't made it obvious, then you've missed what's plain on the nose of your face. The Chargers, still tinkering with their defense, are going to try and outscore people - with what they hope will be the most prolific offense we've seen around here since Don Coryell crouched and grimaced as though eternally constipated on the sidelines while his guys moved the football as if it were engulfed in flames.

Put the vegetables in a 10- to 12-cup baking dish (something that can be brought right to the table is preferable). The filling should reach about 2/3 of the way up the dish; any more than that and it could overflow during cooking. Drop spoonfuls of the cobbler dough over the top and spread to cover big gaps (the dough will expand as it bakes to fill the rest). Bake in the oven for 25 minutes, until the top is nicely browned.
At the end of our street, a tomato plant is growing in the gutter. It’s been growing there quite awhile. That’s a good thing; no one has disturbed it. No one noticed it until about nine days ago, when green tomatoes became evident.

A: I think Nate's drinking is certainly a problem not just for himself, but for the team, because of the danger that he can put them in. They have a dilemma -- they're not sure if they like drunk Nate or sober Nate. They've seen both. Sober Nate can be kind of ornery, a difficult person to be around. Drunk Nate -- it depends which drunk Nate it is. There can sometimes be the functioning one, who's thinking more clearly.

LeBron James: I have no plans at this point. I've made no plans. I wanted to continue to go into my postseason. That's what I geared myself toward. The fact that it's over right now is definitely a surprise to myself. It is what it is. A friend of mine told me today after the game that I guess you have to go through a lot of nightmares before you finally accomplish your dream. That's what's going on individually for myself right now.

But Roche could use a new product with an estimated $1 billion in peak yearly sales. Tight budgets could force governments, including Medicare in the U.S., to limit the prices paid for cancer drugs. Also, the FDA wants to take away Avastin's approval for use in end-stage breast cancer patients, which would hurt U.S. sales. Early this year, Roche lowered its annual sales forecast for Avastin to seven billion Swiss francs, or $7.5 billion, from eight to nine billion Swiss francs.
Parliament can appeal the ruling. But for now the committee's meeting, scheduled for Wednesday, has been postponed.
Still, an across-the-board corporate-tax rollback would run into some serious political problems. Individuals in Illinois pay a flat-rate 5 percent income tax under the new tax hike, meaning a mass rollback of corporate taxes would have those corporations paying a lower rate than an average family does -- not a popular dynamic today. Neither of the new rollback bills does it for individuals, or for small companies that usually don't use the corporate tax structure.

Now, it was as bright as day, even though it was 1 a.m.

After hearing of Brian Elliott's third straight shutout for the Blues, I can't help but wonder why he was so terrible for the Avs and why he's flourishing in St Louis. I understand The Tank stretch last year and a better overall team and D in front of him in St Louis makes a difference but is there more to that story? Did the Avs give up on him too quick? And how does the goalie situation for next year shape up? Both Varly and Jiggy in the plans?

For example, in the immediate aftermath of the recession, the Lindbergh and Ladue districts were the only two in St. Louis County that - because of the particularities of state statutes - were left with no flexibility in adjusting property tax rates on their own. Voters in Lindbergh have since freed the district from those restraints, following up with approval of a 65-cent increase in the operating levy. But even so, the district has seen an $18 million revenue drop since 2008.

Some City Council members, including President Bernard C. "Jack" Young, a longtime advocate for rec centers, are objecting to the privatization plan, and for good reason. Baltimore needs to do everything it can to encourage youths in troubled neighborhoods to participate in the safe and constructive activities rec centers offer, and charging a fee won't help. Neither of the centers where bidder Little Dimples II is proposing to charge fees is in the city's most impoverished neighborhoods, but the precedent is nonetheless disturbing.

Dutch composer Johan Wagenaar (1862-1941) isn't well known today, but on the evidence of his lively, thoroughly Romantic Overture to "Cyrano de Bergerac," he deserves a wider hearing.

Oil and gasoline prices began a steady rise in February, as the Libyan rebellion shut down the country's daily exports of 1.5 million barrels of oil. Libya produces about 2 percent of world demand, and analysts say making up for those losses will severely reduce the ability of other oil-producing countries to increase production in the future. Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries are covering some of the shortfall in Libyan crude, which went mainly to refineries in Europe.

My law would only require that new saws sold in California after 2015 hit a performance standard  not use a specific technology. I am confident that saw makers are able to use the next two years to develop their own safety system at a minimal cost per saw.

The Oregonian’s continuing coverage of Jamal Tarhuni, a U.S. citizen from Tigard who was detained and questioned by the FBI as he tried to return from a relief mission to Libya.Like many others on the list, Tarhuni does not know how he got there. The 55-year-old Tigard businessman discovered his status only recently when the FBI blocked him -- along with Portland-area grocer Mustafa Elogbi -- from flying home from the Middle East.

Stravinsky's score includes a haunting berceuse, or lullaby, sometimes rendered as an enchanting solo for the Firebird. Instead, Ratmansky uses the excerpt as a pas de quatre for Ivan, Kaschei, the marriageable Maiden and the Firebird. Choreographically, it's the equivalent of a Verdi quartet in which each singer vocalizes an inner monologue while the collective voices produce lush harmonies. "All four are moving onstage to the slow part of the music and thinking to themselves about what is happening," Osipova says. "It looks like they are all together, but they are not together. The lullaby is like a magic act."

The primary purpose of applying the franchise tag – at least from the Ravens’ point of view – is to buy some time in order to negotiate a long-term extension with Rice and his agent, Todd France, while making sure that the standout running back can’t hit free agency. That remains the goal this offseason, to get the 25-year-old locked up on a long-term deal. In applying the franchise tag, the Ravens now have until July 16 to reach an agreement before Rice plays under the franchise tag for the 2012 campaign. Ravens’ officials met with France last week at the NFL Scouting Combine. Both sides seem to know that these negotiations are going to take a long time, and the talks will continue after Rice is tagged. The good news for Rice is that the Ravens have a history of using the tag as a precursor to signing the “franchised” player to long-term contract extensions. Terrell Suggs, Chris McAlister and Haloti Ngata all wore the franchise tag before getting a lucrative extension from the team. Will they do the same with Rice before July 16? That remains to be seen, but at least now they have the opportunity to get it done while knowing that their best offensive player isn’t going anywhere at least for one more season.
But fierce opposition from Santorum, who is unlikely to surrender any time soon, may frustrate that effort. So, too, will the continued candidacies of Rep.

That doesn't mean that, but we want as many picks as we can get because I think the draft is all about luck. The more picks you have, the better chance you have to get lucky. We need players at every position across the board. The more picks we have, the better chance we have to hit on a few guys. That's really where we are with that."
The Timbers were barely hanging on in the half, simply trying to escape the barrage without allowing a goal. And they barely escaped when Seattle midfielder Alvaro Fernandez ballooned a shot over the net from point-blank range in the 60th minute.

It’s easy to make fun of the deluded old man who jousts at windmills because he thinks they are ferocious giants. However, the presence of both Cervantes in the prison that provides the framework for the show and of Quixote on his travels, the subject of the play put on by Cervantes and his fierce and violent fellow prisoners as he waits to be called before the Spanish Inquisition, gives hope and inspiration to others.

But here's the thing: The food tastes better there. The best salami sandwich on a hard roll you ever had did not come from a hand-cured-salumi factory, but from the Lido Italian deli when you were 8, and partly because it was always accompanied by an enormous dill pickle that you got to pluck out of a giant barrel, and a little hard candy slipped into your pocket by Mr. Lido.

Moment you committed to being a musician: I had two "'aha' moments," as Oprah would say. Both happened my junior year of high school. The first happened when I participated in a program for African Americans called the Juilliard Exchange. I got to travel by myself to New York City for a week and participate in activities, sit in on classes and experience the Juilliard School dorms. I had an extreme amount of fun, so I was convinced that I had to go to Juilliard after that. The second moment happened at the end of my junior year, when I had the choice of taking an AP calculus class or choosing a second study hall -- basically choosing to go the way of medicine or music. I took the study hall and chose music. Little did I know that I would later have to fulfill a math and science requirement for my bachelor of music degree, and the AP class I had passed over would have given me the credit.
During a recent trip to Mexico, Tribune reporters visited the area in Michoacan where Tolentino grew up and determined that he had been living openly there under his own name after he fled the U.S. In 2008, for example, he registered a pickup truck listing his address in a neighborhood on the south side of Morelia, the state capital.

(On if he thinks the current wide receiver corps is better than they showed in 2011)- "Obviously Greg Little wasn't here when we had this conversation. Greg Little is here, he led our team in receptions, he caught a ton of balls and we think he is going to be better. He looks great right now and Mo (Mohamed Massaquoi) has to come back healthy. The rest of it, we'll have to figure out what happens here in the draft. I think that is a perfect example of where you have to be really, really careful. We want great players at every position, we really do, and that's our goal. To do something just to do something, and that position has been a little up and down in the league. If there is a good one out there, then hey, go get him."

TEST DRIVE NOTES The stretchy character of this bag makes it a good choice for bulky produce and odd-shaped parcels. Although it's a challenge to fill at the checkout counter since it can't stand on its own, it takes up less space than a conventional bag in a pocket or briefcase.

The answer: Hiring is one of the biggest challenges a manager faces. People definitely put their best foot forward in interviews. Therefore you have to rely on a variety of other factors, including situational responses. I favor the non-traditionalist or the creative one.

“While Governor Christie’s grant of clemency was absolutely the right thing to do, Brian Aitken’s case is just one example of how New Jersey's ridiculous gun laws turn law-abiding gun owners into criminals,” Cox said in his statement. “There is a serious need to reform New Jersey’s gun laws so that the full weight of the state’s law enforcement and legal system falls squarely on the shoulders of criminals, not on people like Brian Aitken.”

Thompson alienated much of the technology industry in March when he decided to sue Facebook for alleged infringement on some of Yahoo's Internet patents. The lawsuit has been skewered in Silicon Valley as a cheap shot at Facebook Inc. as it prepared to complete an initial public offering of stock that is aiming to raise as much as $13.6 billion for the company and its current shareholders. Yahoo critics also viewed the lawsuit as the desperate act of a company that has run out of good ideas.

Issue 2 only requires that government workers contribute 10 percent to their retirement. That's all. It doesn't change that guaranteed retirement check.

Boivin said the border agency expects to be functioning at less than 50 percent of normal productivity.
Budish couldn't document his "Ohio history" reference. Information prior to 1968 is difficult, at best, to completely recapture. But it is clear that Ohio never passed a general revenue fund budget prior to 1968 that is anywhere near what lawmakers are presently debating. The 1968-69 budget spent just $2.4 billion.

Note: This recipe for sweet ricotta turnovers — the traditional version — is adapted from "The Little Italy Cookbook: Recipes from North America's Italian Communities" (out of print) by Maria Pace and Louisa Scaini-Jojic. In the preface, the authors credit a woman who says the treats are only made in a village near Trapani. They also note that variations of this theme are popular throughout southern Italy. The authors suggest using a pasta machine to get the dough thin enough; we found the idea worked well.
John Staten, 30, of Orange, was arrested Tuesday and charged with the March beating death of Arthur Downey. At the same time, Laurino said a "manhunt" is under way for two suspects wanted in the shooting death of Victoria Carmen White — a 28-year-old transgender woman from Newark.

NEWARK — A string of car accidents this afternoon caused a shutdown of the Route 21 viaduct near Route 78 and Route 22, sparking heavy delays in Newark, authorities said.
Though critics would say his focus has been too narrow, he's not been exactly one-dimensional. Consider his support for full funding of the county's plan to end homelessness, an ambitious 10-year plan to move homeless people into permanent housing with on-site support services. He also cast votes that extended tax breaks to Intel and Genentech and paved the way for both companies to build and expand their facilities in Washington County.

"Femme Fatale," her new album, is an intermittently winning collection of sleek synth-pop, as streamlined and aerodynamic as a freshly minted luxury automobile. It is also the end stage of Spears’ detachment, and self-effacement: She wrote none of the songs on the album, contributed next to nothing to their production, and allowed her voice to be digitally manipulated to the point of unrecognizability.

There are certainly problems with education in our country today. Schools must assume tasks and responsibilities today that were unthinkable in an earlier time. Funding is tight, and no one likes talking about tax increases. But there are also as many opportunities as there are bright-eyed children plopping down in desk chairs. As a society, we owe it to these children to make sure they are provided with the best teachers, facilities, and resources available-not just on the first day, but every day.
We were prepared to be wowed by all the up-and-comers on the red carpet at the premiere of "The Hunger Games," and we were not disappointed. Star Jennifer Lawrence cemented her place as the one to watch in a hammered gold Prabal Gurung gown with cut-outs (although it could have fit a little better).

Watson was born and raised in Philadelphia. In her early years she found a love for dance, music and children, which led her to pursue her bachelor's degree in Special Education from West Chester University. Her interest in helping others prompted her journey to obtain an master's in School Counseling from Loyola University. Watson uses a variety of approaches to positively impact student reading at City Neighbors: an annual 25-book challenge for each student, one-on-one conferences to help students select books that are just right for them, and the occasional special focus on poetry and plays. This year in particular, she has used arts integration as a way to tap into the students' love and understanding of reading through bookmaking, movement, dance, and drama.

Goldberg was on "Morning Edition" to promote his new book, "The Tyranny of Cliches: How Liberals Cheat in the War of Ideas." I haven't read it, but you can get the gist of what it's about from his interview; Goldberg rails against what he considers an unfair debate technique used by liberals, who fall back on cliches rather than seriously addressing conservative arguments and ideas. "I don't agree with what you say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it" is one such liberal cliche. Goldberg pointed out that this is not only a lie -- very few people would really be willing to take a bullet to defend someone else's free-speech rights -- but it's pablum for people who lack the intellectual firepower to mount a real debate.

Unlike Port, von Lohmann didn't believe the verdict would raise settlement costs for file-sharing defendants because the industry doesn't want more trials like Thomas-Rasset's.
"Football gave her a bonus to get a car," Morgan told Long, according to the notes. The purchase of the black Acura apparently came three days after she was hired. Dorrell quit her job Tuesday and received $14,000 in what the school described only as a settlement payment.

Still, as Romney is hardly known for his maverick tendencies, such advice may not be necessary. Safe and boring seems to be a mantra not lost on the former governor of Massachusetts. It's difficult to imagine him choosing a loose cannon (sorry, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie) or even a vanquished foe (Sen. Rick Santorum can probably put away the sweater vests).

Soldiers and members of India's disaster response team hauled the remains of the ferry from the river using ropes tied to two tractors. Lal said that they managed to lift the wreckage enough to be sure no bodies were trapped inside.
Hairston, filling in for the sore-wristed Juan Uribe at third base, also made an outstanding play in the third inning. Altuve hit a ball hard off his glove and it ricocheted deep down the line in foul territory. It appeared an easy double.
Dan Rubinstein, the district attorneys' representative on a drug task force, also argued against the bill. He said defense attorneys he's talked to say the threat of a felony is more effective than a misdemeanor conviction, and prosecutors fear it would undercut sentencing reforms passed in recent years.

NEW YORK — Sandy Alderson knows this much: Daniel Murphy is a major-leaguer, a legitimate hitter, a player he wants to have in the Mets’ lineup in the coming years.
But I'm not sure this law would have helped. Our do-gooder Legislature is almost certain to pass AB 1450, but don't expect this "discrimination" to end or for unemployment to fall any faster. Instead, employers will find ways to skirt the law or simply make do with the workers they've got until the economy picks up again. Count on it.
During an interview with Phoenix Police Child Crime detectives, the girl told officers of at least one instance of sexual intercourse, several instances of sexual contact over nearly a five year range, and of the molestation of her older sister by her father, Holmes said.

Like a few million other women, I'm besotted with a vampire. What do we want from "Breaking Dawn," the fourth movie in the "Twilight" series? A honeymoon with Rob, of course. The book series was a sensation among teen girls and some of their mothers. But when Robert Pattinson appeared on screen with his strong jaw, yearning eyes and thick, tousled hair, even those of us who didn't care to read every volume were entranced. Despite some cheesy special effects and a ridiculous love triangle between a sulky girl; a chaste, mumbling vampire; and a lusty, buffed werewolf, the "Twilight" movies are one of my ongoing guilty pleasures.
øBut by supplementing that lower-tier Cup ride with Kyle Busch Motorsports - the brothers are sharing the No. 54 Toyota in Nationwide behind Monster Energy sponsorship - Kurt, 33, found more of an opportunity for success.

So far this season, in 244 contests there have been nine complete games. Pitchers aren't mentally trained to go nine innings, because they know that once the 7th inning comes around, the manager is ready to reach for the phone to activate the bullpen.

First, and perhaps foremost, is the timing of the hospital's accusations that I implanted stents in patients who did not need them. These charges, which originated from someone within the hospital community, conveniently surfaced as St. Joseph Medical Center and its Denver-based owner Catholic Health Initiatives (CHI) was entangled in a federal investigation of misconduct between them and MidAtlantic Cardiovascular Associates. As my troubles became front-page news, St. Joseph Medical Center moved to the back page.
The look: Little has changed in the way of decor from the Tomo days. The shopping center storefront consists of a cozy dining room with contemporary furnishings anchored by a compact L-shaped sushi bar in the back corner. But, somehow, the simple atmosphere exudes a kind of serene charm.

Breitbart stumbled in the summer of 2010, when he posted a deceptively edited video purporting to show racist statements by an obscure African American government official named Shirley Sherrod. Sherrod, whose story actually illustrated how she overcame feelings of racism to help a white farmer save his land, was fired. Embarrassed, the Agriculture Department offered her a new job. She sued Breitbart for defamation. (Attorney Michael Rothbert, an expert on media law, said Sherrod could sue his estate.)

Melanie Sloan, a former federal prosecutor who heads the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, suggested that the prosecution's goal is for the jury to "hate John Edwards so much they'll convict him."
A: I actually didn't watch "The Social Network" while I was doing the book kind of deliberately because I didn't want it to color anything I was writing or reviewing or anything else. Then when I saw the movie, there's a shot at the beginning of the movie of Harvard Square, where I found the magazine with the Altair on the cover. That and some of the other things in that movie were kind of strange echoes of some of the things that happened in the book. That's kind of an interesting aspect. I think when you get someone doing a magazine excerpt they look kind of for the thing that's going to attract the most attention and cause the most interest. I think if you read the whole book cover to cover ... you've read the whole book, right?
Doctors like to say that breast cancer is not a single disease, but a range of them. But because they don't completely understand which therapies will work for a given tumor and why, they tend to err on the side of caution - administering treatments in cases in which they may provide little benefit.
Afterthought: If you knew column contributor Irwin Sirotta’s Ancient Men of the C’s would go 24-10 over their final 34 games, then I’m guessing you also knew John Edwards was a dedicated family man.
Santorum had 30 percent support to 28 percent for Romney in a national poll released this week by the Pew Research Center. But the same poll said 31 percent of all adults had never heard of or couldn't rate him. That's a significantly higher number than for Romney, Gingrich, or Ron Paul. Even among Republicans, one in five told Pew they didn't know enough about Santorum to rate him.

So what happened at the store level in San Francisco? Retailers went back to the future and increased the use of paper bags. Paper bags are biodegradable and easily recyclable at the curb, but unless they've been manufactured in a carbon-neutral plant and earned a Sustainable Forestry Initiative certification, they most likely take more energy and emit more greenhouse gases during production than plastic bags. It also takes double the trucks to get the same quantity to market. So much for winning the race to the headlines.
The Rams entered the weekend with only four linebackers on their roster. When the draft ended, they had only five, and the fifth – Hawaii's Aaron Brown – wasn't added until the seventh round.

Every month or so after that, he said, another "Wanted" bulletin would cross his desk from another police department searching for that same woman. She was in Brea and Costa Mesa, Las Vegas and Tucson. She had light hair, dark hair, tattoos visible or hidden. The story was always the same: She had used a stolen identity to clear money from a victim's bank account.
"I'm glad I can present a polished version of myself when it counts. When I was on 'Idol,' I said some dumb stuff, and learned what that could do, and that stuff lives on," said the Oklahoma native.

The "Twilight" saga's supernatural soap opera reaches a ludicrously high pitch in the first half of concluding volume "Breaking Dawn," which includes a wedding, an accelerated pregnancy and a major transformation for a major character. All that would be fine if the franchise's creative team had any sense of fun about what they're making (a la "True Blood"). Instead, new "Twilight" director Bill Condon continues what his predecessors started, making a movie that's dreary and self-serious. The fans, though, will continue to eat it up and should also appreciate the Condon commentary track and extensive featurettes on the DVD and Blu-ray.

The pilot made an immediate impact on those who saw it, though it was polarizing, with plenty of critics finding it overdone.

The court filing seeks alimony for the longtime engineer's estranged wife and child support for the Neumans' 17-year-old daughter, the youngest of the couple's three children.
It's telling that even Anya knew that she should not have won. She was ready to give up. She basically gave Tim Gunn her goodbye speech before the runway. She was proud of that final collection, as she should be (a girl who'd been sewing for maybe six months by then, makes it to Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week, that's stellar), but she should not be among the Project Runway grand prize winners.
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a case about brutality and cruelty,'' Hestrin told the jury in his opening statement.
Mind you, this is not a discussion between believers and unbelievers. It's a widening gap between churched Christians and unchurched Christians. And if you think "unchurched Christian" is an oxymoron, I hear you. I tend to agree. Being adopted into the Body of Christ is one of the gifts of salvation. Why would you intentionally cut yourself off from the richness that is the church?

All the "body of work" items -- Tressel's personal kindness on many levels, the inspirational messages to students and players, the patriotic gestures to troops in the Middle East -- will never be known. But the stories are real, and, by the hundreds, especially here in his hometown, people who came into contact with him can attest to them. On many personal "scoreboards," Tressel, despite the scandal, is still ahead.

Authorities believe that, like the Christmas bomb and the printer bombs, this latest device is the handiwork of either al-Qaida's master bomb maker in Yemen, Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, or one of his students.
The impact is felt more, Martin said, among disadvantaged communities. Studies have shown that children from low socioeconomic and racial or ethnic minority backgrounds are diagnosed an average of two to four years later than others. These groups are misdiagnosed at higher rates and instead labeled with emotional problems.

Much of this satisfying tale is told in the details as King lavishes us with descriptions and behaviors of the late '50s and early '60s, as seen from Jake's point of view. The music, the gigantic cars, the cheap gas and the unshaken assumption that America is the land of the free, home of the brave - for the most part.

Robbie Keane. Just as the champs have started to find their defensive rhythm, yielding only four goals in the past four games, the offense has hit a bit of a bump. L.A. needed a late goal from sub Pat Noonan to eke out a 1-1 draw with FCD in a game that was highlighted by a penalty kick miss by Irish star Robbie Keane. Landon Donovan normally takes the PKs, but he made way for Keane—who hadn't scored in three games—when the Galaxy were awarded the spot kick early in the second half.

It's no wonder. This aquarium is probably the only saltwater body in Florida where you will encounter 40 species of marine life in a 45-minute dive. There are no rough seas, no strong currents and the tank is only 27 feet deep. The only drawback is the constant 77-degree water temperature — relatively chilly for a South Florida diver, but spa conditions for fish, rays, turtles and sharks that hail from the Caribbean.

"Modding" is far from new in some walks of life -- car enthusiasts have tuned engines and turned factory models into hot rods for generations, with computer tinkerers and gadget freaks following suit. But tinkering has now become an increasingly normal part of consumer life: If you've ever changed a PC screensaver to your own photo, you've taken one small step into the world of modding. And if you've ever been surprised to discover that your desktop littered with icons and application windows looks nothing like your colleague's pristine monitor, you've discovered how customization can make the same program or machine feel very different. (Language sticklers will argue that "modding" is reserved for making a device do something its creators didn't intend, but I think that's too purist. The normal function of devices and programs now includes vastly more range than playing with the TV's contrast knob or tilting your steering wheel.)

I flew, and John drove his old Toyota 4Runner loaded with gear, from L.A. to Las Vegas, a good staging point for trips into the canyon lands of Utah and Arizona. He has logged 245,000 chassis-battering miles in that vehicle, and I don't trust it. So I rented an SUV at the airport, where John met me.

Mr. Khullar, the commerce secretary, said he is hopeful India can reduce its trade deficit to $150 billion in the year that began April 1. That depends on global oil prices stabilizing, as India's energy demand shows no sign of letting up. Consumption of refined fuel products rose 4.9% in the last fiscal year, its highest pace in four years, on the back of growth in vehicle sales and demand for diesel-powered generators to cope with power outages, according to data released Wednesday.

Though Avakian did play a big role in those 2007 bills, other legislators and lobbyists pointed out that the Democrats that year gained a majority in both houses for the first time in nearly two decades. As a result, lobbyists were much more willing to cut compromises on the bills, which had strong Democratic backing. And the vocational education bill that Avakian pushed this year contains $2 million, enough to start programs in 10 schools. It's far from certain whether future legislatures will come up with the money to pay for shop in all schools.

In short, you would disable every religious community from considering the scriptural and doctrinal implications of a candidate while they still have time to do something about it. That is one reason that a pastor's "individual" right to speak is not enough. Christian pastors have long felt the obligation to inform their congregations on engaging the broader culture. Pastors have praised and panned American military leaders, celebrities, business moguls and even sitting politicians, often to good effect. But when it comes to the congregation's obligation to vote, vote wisely and vote morally, only one class of Americans gets a free pass from the pulpit's moral scrutiny: candidates.

Meet the new face of the food cart revolution: Roving gastro-trucks that mash up ethnic cuisines, pop culture and affordability, then post their ever-shifting locations to a wired clientele through Twitter and Web sites. In Portland that means Koi Fusion, which launched in June when business grad Bo Kwon hit the streets in an $80,000 food truck with a spicy mix of Korean barbecue tacos, kimchi quesadillas and Korean fries. Now Kwon draws followers on the command of a tweet -- often to PGE Park or PSU but also renegade spots. And wherever Koi lands, the feel is of an instant party, fed by a communal condiment station and a great playlist. (Watch video here.)

O’Donovan is another childhood player turned soccer dad (he coaches his sons’ teams), and remembers playing in Ireland alongside cows in the fields, feeling lucky when he was kicking a ball that was actually inflated. “It’s a poor man’s game.” But in America, O’Donovan is also eyewitness to a grass-roots evolution. The United States has more fans, thanks to an improved national team and more children who play the game. But most important, O’Donovan believes, is that we now have a second generation of American soccer players — that today’s soccer kids have parents who also played.

IPS desperately needs a leader who understands that the district is in need of a major shake-up. It needs an infusion of talent in leadership roles, but, unlike The Mind Trust's plan, White's pays only lip service to human capital. It needs students who arrive at kindergarten prepared to learn. But while The Mind Trust plan would shift spending from the bloated IPS headquarters to early learning, White offers no serious plan to expand such programs. IPS needs to be a place where the brightest education minds want to work, but under White it remains a district that can crush the spirit of any innovator.

There you have the story in a nutshell. The real fares on either line are virtually identical, at $2,140.10 (sorry, but I can't explain that 8 cent difference). The two lines just chose the way they presented the final figure: honestly on United, not so honestly on Lufthansa. Parenthetically, both lines offered lower fares on some connecting itineraries, but fares to Europe really are high this summer.
A complex, century-jumping narrative about the great Renaissance scientist, a modern astronomer and a Creationist, each with their willful offspring, “Dear Galileo” attempts a reconciliation of fathers and daughters, faith and science, psychology and cosmology. At this stage of development, its romantic subplot is less compelling than its astrophysics primers, but this is nonetheless a very promising work.

One thing that hasn't changed: Sherlock and Watson remain ideal foils for each other, thanks to whip-smart dialogue delivered flawlessly by Benedict Cumberbatch ("War Horse") and Martin Freeman ("The Hobbit"). Their bickering leads to more laugh-out-loud moments than most sitcoms.
As the movie jumps from one couple to the next, with everybody stealing strategies and counter-strategies from the same bestseller by Harvey (who appears on screen as well), a funny thing happens. We begin to care about how some of these folks work it out. Scenes entirely off the plot, set on the basketball court or in a bar, generate real laughs. And it's a pleasure to see Taraji P. Hensondig down into a cliche — that of a high-powered, tightly wound businesswoman (known here, queasily, as the Woman Who Is Her Own Man) — and come back with someone a little bit complicated. Compare Henson's work here to Janet Jackson swallowing the more melodramatic"Why Did I Get Married Too?" whole, and you have the difference between a sparkling team player playing with equally strong cohorts, and a one-gulp solo act.

With nothing to engage the mind, "The Hunger Games" aims for the heart. Katniss' tentative romance with a fellow contestant, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), is surprisingly sweet and touching -- he and Lawrence share all of the film's best moments -- but there's something rote and programmed about it, too. You never question whether things will work out for them, because this is an overly timid movie about a wild and outrageous concept.

But Ms. Newhouse has learned that ideal acoustics are not even necessary for a hall to succeed. The essential factor is ambience—the sum total of how a place looks, feels and sounds, an intangible combination that satisfies the senses and fills an important but unexpressed social need that extends from the audience's shared experience to its communication with the performing artists. Lincoln Center's much-maligned Avery Fisher (formerly Philharmonic) Hall, with its highly publicized, multiple corrective remodelings, is considered by visiting orchestras to be far better than its dodgy reputation.

Natural gas prices dropped after the Energy Information Administration reported that the nation's natural gas supplies grew by 43 billion cubic feet in the past week. Analysts expected a smaller increase because the intense heat wave that blanketed the eastern half of the country last week led to high electricity demand. About 20 percent of the nation's electricity is generated with natural gas. During spikes in electricity demand, like last week, utilities rely on natural gas more heavily.
Bacon's "Figure Writing," which depicts the artist and his partner, George Dyer, writing at a table, was included in a 1977 Paris exhibition alongside "Triptych," a 1976 work by the artist that sold for $86.2 million at Sotheby's in 2008.

Behind us, the mustard-yellow walls of the high-ceilinged old storefront caught the last of the day's light. The decor is simple. Abstract art in shades of blue is well-lit on the walls. Tables and chairs are plain, honey- colored wood; no tablecloths or place mats, and napkins are clothlike paper. Water arrives in wine bottles and wine in tumblers, along with a generous basket of Acme bread.

A rags-to-riches American Dream story, "Rocky" won three Oscars and spawned five sequels. The story of an uneducated but kind-hearted debt collector who gets a shot at the world heavyweight championship starred Sylvester Stallone and Burgess Meredith, both of whom nabbed nods for their acting. From the Italian Market to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, locations seen in the film are bountiful.
Selling the shares now would result in deeper losses than taxpayers incurred on the $33-per-share initial offering.

Nor do they have the benefit of having strong careers built on good work. Wayne survived being John Wayne while trying to play Genghis Khan in "The Conqueror," as Costner survived being Kevin Costner playing Robin Hood in "Prince of Thieves." Mickey Rooney survived playing the Mr. Yunioshi character, complete with every ugly Japanese stereotype, in "Breakfast at Tiffany's." Even Adam Sandler's résumé of delinquent goofiness (there's definitely a market for it) saved him from thinking he could play a former NFL quarterback in the remake of "The Longest Yard."
The size of the seats is not a function of passenger weight but a legacy of airplane design from a generation ago, said Vern Alg, a former airline executive who is now a private consultant.

One day, we received a company-wide email from our vice president of television, Greg Sansone, who urged us to fill out a one-page form if we had any show ideas. Thirty minutes later, I was in his office talking about what I had written -- a "post-game show" for WWE Raw, which would air after our Raw replay on Tuesday afternoons. That show, now known as "Aftermath", began in December 2009 and is still going strong today, with two episodes a week on TV (Tuesday and Friday nights) and an audio podcast on Monday nights after Raw, which I co-host with one of my closest friends, Jimmy Korderas, a former longtime WWE referee who I like to call "The Greek Bald Badass."

First, writer Piper Weiss on Yahoo's Shine talks with this season's female competitors about why women can't seem to win the "Top Chef" title. It's worth considering. In eight seasons of the show, Stephanie Izard is the lone female winner, and men have won the first two seasons of the spin-off "Top Chef Masters," as well as the first season of "Top Chef Just Desserts." Tiffany Derry, who made it to the semi-finals, says she thinks Antonia Lofaso should have made it to the finals, and that the show is a microcosm of gender politics in professional kitchens. Choice quote: "I feel like we're more attached to certain things," adds Tiffany. "Certain people mess up as much as anybody else but for us it's an emotional thing."

Large banks provide convenience, a wide variety of services and online capability. Most large banks can provide you with a specialist regarding financial services. Some have a banker that specializes in small business loans. Unfortunately, fees will likely be higher at large banks than at the alternatives, and lately many large banks are increasing their fees. Nonetheless, sometimes, for a specific service, a large bank will provide you with the best value (this is generally the case with credit cards). That's why it's important to include them when judging the available alternatives for a particular service.

Boorstin, who taught at the University of Chicago for 25 years, won the Pulitzer Prize and became the librarian of Congress (he died in 2004), was writing at a time when traditional culture was under assault from mass culture, and he didn't much like it. He believed in unalterable truths that had withstood the test of eons — things like heroism, art, primary experiences and high ideals. These were prima facie good. He also believed that anything that drew us away from these truths harmed ourselves and our culture. And he lamented that that was exactly what mass culture was doing to the country. It was substituting the false for the true, the dark arts of public relations and self-aggrandizement for the higher purposes of human existence.

Today, I may be the victim, but tomorrow it may be you, until the whole fabric of our harmonious society is ripped apart at a time of great national peril."

Youll hear that it will effectively end the Medicare guarantee and raise health care costs for seniors. Youll hear that it raises the retirement age for Social Security while slashing benefits for younger workers. Youll hear that it makes deep cuts to education, which is slashed by 45%, and reduces spending for our roads and bridges by 24%. Youll also hear that it hands out billions of dollars in taxpayer funded subsidies to oil companies while Michiganders are stuck paying over $4 per gallon of gas. And youll hear that it requires most Americans to accept these sacrifices so that we can provide new tax breaks to reward corporations for shipping jobs overseas and tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires.

Obama's speech last week suggested that he sees the wealthy almost as a parasite class. Over and over, he demanded that these plutocrats pay their fair share or do their part, as if he had no idea that the top 10 percent of earners already shoulder 70 percent of the income tax load or that nearly half of American households pay no income tax at all.

So what we prefer to do is have them drinking nothing but water and trying to isolate their snack into one particular time. Sit down, eat as much of it as you're going to let them have, take it away, and then don't do it again for another few hours. And we push for a little healthier snacks — fruit, vegetables, cheeses, that kind of thing.
The idea of publicly rating teachers by name has generated enormous controversy among educators and experts across the country. The debate has focused on whether the method is sound and the publicity is fair to those with low rankings.

"Anonymous" also sharpens its literary-lore blades to go after the myth and reality of the Bard in a period drama with more modern overtones. The twist is that the movie suggests all of those great plays were penned by Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford, and that Will Shakespeare was not so much the Bard, but a beard, a mere front for de Vere's unending output and political messages.

And here's what Cinco de Mayo is not, despite all the signs in bar windows inviting revelers to drink: It's not Mexico's Independence Day, and it's barely marked in Mexico, except in the state of Puebla, where the holiday is rooted in a complicated and short-lived 1862 military victory over the French.

Many Indians fans agonize over their team sending its top pitching prospects -- Alex White and Drew Pomeranz -- plus two other minor leaguers to Colorado for him. The Indians have contractual rights to Jimenez through 2013 and expect him to anchor the pitching staff for the next two years.

That year, though, the California Attorney General's office sued, claiming YTB was a "gigantic pyramid scheme." The suit and a similar one in Illinois, were settled, but forced fines and big changes to the company's business model. The last few years have seen management shakeups, more business-model changes and steadily dwindling sales. Through the first nine months of 2011 – the most recent data available – revenue was $21.1 million, with losses of $3.3 million and just $189,000 in cash on hand. Last year, YTB sold its headquarters for $7.1 million. In February, it sold 19 acres next door for $500,000.

Looked like the Cowboys talked the Giants into running left on the failed fourth-and-1 late in the third quarter with some of their pre-snap movement. Manning appeared to change the play at the line because he saw the Cowboys’ front favoring the right side of the Giants’ line. But at the snap, they slanted the other way right into where the Giants were trying to run. That helped leave Lee unblocked for the stop. During the Cowboys’ mini-run, I had visions of that being a play we’d be talking about for days. The Giants’ winning the fourth quarter made sure it was all but forgotten by game’s end.
And, no, the brassiere size is not a typo.
In fact, the two baby troops reminded me of some bizarre simian version of William Golding's Lord of the Flies. Instead of a group of school-age boys stranded on an island, these were motherless baboons kept separate from the adults for their own safety. They seemed to try to embody adult roles that in a real troop would have been filled by mature baboons. It was the job of the human volunteers to try to fill that adult role.

NuLu is a short walk from both spots as well as downtown's more traditional highlights, such as the Louisville Slugger and Muhammad Ali museums.

Kevin Pelton: When a player and team part ways, we often hear it compared to a divorce. In the case of Jamal Crawford and the Blazers, I think this is more like an annulment. Both sides had the best of intentions in December, but it just never worked. Crawford isn't a point guard, which Portland needed him to be for the rotation to work, and he's not really the kind of veteran leader the Blazers needed in the locker room when things came apart. So assuming Crawford opts out, he's likely to find a better fit while Portland goes in a superior direction by promoting Elliot Williams to backup two.
He gave up only two homers in his first four games, a sign of how things had changed. Now, his back is a concern again.

A: It sounds like the tree is dead. The branches that started to come back were just the last burst of energy left in the tree - the last hurrah, so to speak. Too much of the plant had probably succumbed to the frost. Ficus trees grow pretty quickly, so if you planted a new one, it would not take long for it to reach a good size. However, you might consider something a little more appropriate for the desert that can handle the occasional hard freeze.

The parts that were specifically not belted for effect were merely reminders of the fact that this song was too tall an order for our Rhode Island DJ/wedding singer. Randy said "Let yourself go." Erika needs to stop playing it safe.

The results are dramatic. In 1974, people who identified themselves as conservatives were the most likely group to have a high degree of trust in science; now they're the least trustful. As Gauchat argues, this can probably be blamed on both the growing influence of the religious right, which rejects scientific contradictions of religious teachings on such issues as evolution and stem-cell research, and the growing use of science to inform public policy in such areas as environmental protection. Conservatives, ever wary of government interference with the free market, started to resent the scientists whose findings suggested such interference was necessary. Rather than debate remedies, they have turned on science itself.

Dear My: I would stop smiling. What is going on is somewhere between dim and mean. While I am generally in favor of using humor to defuse uncomfortable situations, I am not recommending it in your case because this aggressive effort to push food on you that is harmful is beyond someone saying things that are merely thoughtless. No offense, but these family members are either incredibly thick or strangely unconcerned with your health. The next time this happens, I would ask: "What part of my doctor's orders do you not understand? And why would you want me to eat something that would cause a serious reaction? While you are free to eat whatever you like, I would consider it a favor if you would not rave about something you are enjoying that you know I cannot have." When people seriously misstep, I have no interest in sparing their feelings. — Margo, directly
Many people think doing only one menu is easy, and it does eliminate some of the challenges of sourcing and stocking ingredients. Yet, while the menus are loosely planned a week or so in advance, they aren't finalized until the last 48 hours. If something else interesting is available that day, the menu can change again. While that means the kitchen can respond to an ever-changing marketplace, it also puts a lot of pressure on the staff. Plus, if you're doing only one menu, each course needs to hit the bull's-eye.

Steve Schoenfeld, ESPN.com: "I can imagine a secret society of Jack Quinn fans, holed up in an Elks Lodge somewhere ready to pop bottles of champagne with each Jamie Moyer loss or no-decision. You know, sort of like members of the 1972 Miami Dolphins when an undefeated NFL team finally loses late in the season. Quinn, of course, was the oldest pitcher to win a major league game, 49 years old and change when he pitched five scoreless innings of relief for the Brooklyn Dodgers on Sept. 13, 1932, to pick up the victory in a 6-5 win over the St. Louis Cardinals. Those imaginary bottles can be permanently put to rest now. Moyer pitched seven brilliant innings on Tuesday night at Coors Field -- well, as brilliant as a Moyer outing can be -- allowing only two unearned runs as the Colorado Rockies won 5-3. It was career win No. 268 for Moyer, tying him with Jim Palmer and more victories than Bob Feller or Carl Hubbell or Bob Gibson or Juan Marichal. And at 49 years and 150 days, he surpassed Quinn in the record books."

A similar sense of crisis impels Campbell's second novel, "Once Upon a River," which also deals with a 16-year-old adrift on a river, in the wake of tragedy. Actually, the novel has its roots in another "American Salvage" story, "Family Reunion," about a girl taking apt revenge on the uncle who abused her. That character is named Marylou; in "Once Upon a River," Campbell changes it to Margo, but the girl is the same, as is the essence of her journey — which is ostensibly to find the mother who abandoned her but is really about putting some distance between herself and her history and finding a way to navigate the world.

The rally was a undeniable success: Hundreds of kids from Southridge and other area schools showed up on a Saturday to hear speeches from activists and politicians.

The United States seems to have two plans to deal with what is fast becoming a civil war in Syria. Plan A calls for the full implementation of the U.N. cease-fire and the complete cooperation of Bashar al-Assad, a dictator who would, at the risk of his very life, give up some power to the opposition. Plan B, on the other hand, envisions a military response through air power. For that to be implemented, Plan A must fail and more Syrians must die.

Rise before dawn. Get to the Griffith Observatory parking lot (which is free but fills fast). Start at the Charlie Turner Trailhead, just north of the lot, and hike uphill. You're climbing Mt. Hollywood, whose peak (1,625 feet) offers staggering views. It's a three-mile round trip through scrub and chaparral, the pines of Berlin Forest and the shady oasis of Dante's View. From the mountaintop on a clear day, you can see the sun rise to the east and a sliver of Pacific to the west. Almost every day, you'll get an eyeful of the Los Angeles basin, the San Fernando Valley, the San Gabriel Mountains and the Hollywood sign on nearby Mt. Lee. (There's no hike to the Hollywood sign, and no access to it. Do this instead.) As the mist lifts from the ridges, listen to the birdsong — and the Koreans. Dozens of Korean Americans like to begin their days with hikes here. So does City Councilman Tom LaBonge, who hollers greetings in their language and carries a football on his dawn hikes. He's been on this trail daily since 1978.

And it's not the 10 little Indians when she sings the song, it's the 10 little pennies it takes to buy a piece of bubble gum.

Exercising in the a.m. makes you more likely to stick with your workout routine, according to various studies. But the prime time for fitness is also the worst time for your outdoor allergies. Generally, pollen counts peak in the morning between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m., says Frederick M. Schaffer, MD, chief medical officer of United Allergy Services. Unless you can get yourself in the habit of rising with the sun, consider moving your run to lunchtime or immediately after work. "Trees don't like to pollinate when it's very warm out," says Paul Ehrlich, MD, a fellow of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology and the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. "During the day pollen is less of a problem-but in the mornings and evenings when it's cool and there's a breeze, the pollen just goes crazy."

There are so many exemplars of not giving up and then making it to the top of the talent and non-broke rung. Another is actor-comedian Jim Carrey, who had to live in his car for more than a few weeks before his big break arrived. As chronicled in one of my A SENIOR MOMENT webcasts (www.startribune.com/video) a few weeks ago, even Gregory Peck, one of the greatest actors of all time, often slept on benches in Central Park because he couldn't afford to pay apartment rent during his fledgling acting days in New York.

He most recently played George Clooney's father-in-law in THE DESCENDANTS.)

Most of the film's technical effects are squirmy miscalculations. The photography is deliberately dingy, evoking the squalid atmosphere of small-town sports locker rooms. This movie looks like athlete's foot smells.

I’ve decided to name it ‘Pam.’” And sure, you could hire a weekly housecleaner with the money you’re saving by cohabiting and make filing systems and lists and chore wheels, but the reality is, you probably need somebody to follow you around with a shovel.

Some people see helicopter mom in this list; others might see just plain neurotic person.

This trend is not new among African-Americans, but such firms multiplied at a much faster pace in the Garden State, which saw a 72 percent jump during the five-year window, compared to 13 percent for the nation, the data shows.

Newfield and the man who followed her to the stage, Rodney Atkins, suffered sound issues. Both sounded muffled, almost as if they didn't have access to the highs, lows and mids of the speaker set-up. But Atkins got better as his set wore on, especially after he ditched the headset mike and went for a regular hand-held.

U.S. officials have been passing the word that the objects of the exercise are to react to the recent launch of China's first aircraft carrier and its development of the Dong-Feng 21D "carrier killer" missile capable of sinking any aircraft carriers in the region; increase American influence in the South China Sea, much of which China claims as sovereign territory; and reassure allies in Asia that the U.S. will retain a strong presence in the region to counter a rising Chinese military presence.

He's as tough-talking as Charles de Gaulle and, like the cantankerous general who ruled France four decades ago, Nicolas Sarkozy is determined to save France from its single biggest enemy: the French.

Currently minister of the interior under President Jacques Chirac, the 51-year-old Sarkozy is already considered the centrist UMP party's leading presidential candidate in April's French national elections. He is no favorite of incumbent Chirac (their relations are often as frosty as frozen foie gras). Yet while Chirac's popularity steadily plummets, Sarkozy's is on the rise. Here's why: Sarkozy comes bearing a tough-love message for his people that's long overdue: Arrogant France has fallen behind. Between lack of economic initiative, ravenous welfare costs and immigration woes, this once powerful nation has become a European sick man. If the country wants to drag itself out of those doldrums, Sarkozy says, it's going to have to stop resting on its aging laurels. It must radically reform its perverse handout economy - where people work only 35 hours a week - and start to puts its nose to the grindstone. What's more, in order to win the war on global terrorism, he insists, France has to join hands with its allies - not throw diplomatic tacks in their path. And how's this for a breath of fresh air? Unlike all other French leaders of the last 50 years, Sarkozy genuinely admires America and Americans. He made that loud and clear when he visited the U.

Showoffs' see-through quart-size reusable bag with three empty bottles may seem too boring for even a stocking stuffer, but with a little creativity it makes a handy gift for the frequent traveler. Label the bottles and fill them with your own vacation favorites - an invigorating citrus shower gel, the broad spectrum sunscreen you swear by. Or bring them to your local health food store where you're likely to find a great array of lotions and potions in bulk. Don't worry about spillage: The bottle closures are leak resistant.

Trade agreements are good for Oregon exporters because they eliminate tariffs that U.S. exporters pay as they enter foreign markets. For example, in 2003, Chile signed a trade agreement with South Korea, and their market share for wine grew from 2 percent to 23 percent. U.S. winegrowers still pay an average tariff of 15 percent on wine exports to South Korea and are priced out of most of the market. This trade agreement with South Korea would eliminate this tariff, opening new markets for Oregon winegrowers.

If the real question is how often schools suspend students — which obviously affects black students more than other groups — the answer is simple: far too often. Ordinarily, the public thinks of zero tolerance as invoking consequences for drugs or weapons. But in recent years, it has been applied in alarming numbers to much less serious violations — especially disruptive behavior. The idea is that by removing the troublemaker for a day or more, the school becomes a calmer place where others can achieve.

If Iran continues to inch toward the bomb, our policy should take a page from how the international community has handled North Korea the past two decades. The first Bush administration believed that Pyongyang probably had one or two bombs, yet neither President George H.W. Bush nor President Bill Clinton threatened war over that capability. In 1994, however, when North Korea threatened to reprocess plutonium for more bombs and build large reactors that could create the material for several dozen a year, Defense Secretary William Perry was emphatic that a North Korean nuclear arsenal could not be tolerated. His warning was heard loud and clear in Pyongyang, and the agreed framework resulted.

"In a funny way, sometimes it works out for you and sometimes it doesn't. Every one of those guys are trying hard," Elias said.

43': France earns a free kick in the waning moments of the first half. It should be noted that French midfielder Camille Abily is really good.

Another new character is the spidery mythical figure Arachne (T.V. Carpio). Pulled from the depths of Greek mythology, her role is confusing.

Wall Street is also worried: A ratings agency this week downgraded the trust fund’s credit rating for last week’s round of borrowing. Moody’s Investors Service said its outlook for the state’s transportation funding system is "negative," saying New Jersey’s nearly $40 billion debt burden and depleted operating revenues would give the trust fund little flexibility in the event of an emergency.
Yet the commission thus far has been largely absent without leave. This isn't an accident. Under Reagan, conservatives began to cut away at the commission, reducing its budget and staff. In theory, the eight-member commission is bipartisan, with no party having more than four members. Then, under George Bush, two Republican activists changed their registration to "independent," enabling conservatives to hold six seats on the commission, rendering it less useful. By 2011, Wade Henderson, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, issued a report concluding that the commission was "so debilitated as to be considered moribund."

MIDDLE TWP. — A Green Creek teenager has been charged with assaulting three students outside Middle Township High School on Wednesday by blowing darts at them, police said.
An uneasy feeling swept over Gottl. "I wondered," she said, "what I needed to worry about."
Authorities say the assaults began in the mid-1980s and lasted until 2002, when the parents separated, and occurred at residences in Paterson, East Orange, Orange and Eatontown. Prosecutors say the man ordered all his children to be born at home to remain undocumented, deprived them of food and medical care, kept them out of school and threatened them with death if they told anyone.

"Bullies have been around since the beginning of civilization, and they aren't going away anytime soon," Rener and his famous siblings note on GracieKids.com "The U.S. Government's website against bullying provides no sound solution for a child who is targeted by a persistent bully, and the string of highly publicized youth suicides is evidence that the schools cannot be entrusted with your child's safety." The Gracie Jiu-Jitsu bully-proofing and women's empowerment seminars are not purely technique seminars. They are mainly open forums of discussion about how not to get into bad situations and/or how to diffuse them quickly if possible. The seminars are life changing and powerful. Rener's teaching of simple techniques empowers students to stand up for themselves.

The pact-signing and Obama's address to the troops came one year almost to the hour that U.S. special forces killed bin Laden. Senior White House officials acknowledged that the trip fell on the anniversary, but they said the timing was driven by the desire of both presidents to have the strategic partnership agreement signed, in Afghanistan, before a NATO summit scheduled for Chicago this month.
For Ms. Mills, designs start with a scrap of paper, a mechanical pencil and an idea. "It's doodling," she said. She has been inspired by seeing a girdle—and has become well-known for her high-waisted briefs. She is often inspired by lingerie, or random photos and videos. When someone sent her a video of singer Shelby Lynne rehearsing, it was the muted terra cotta and forest green colors of the room that grabbed her attention.
It’s a matter of security, Donahue said, to ensure that people won’t misuse the visa (overstaying their allotted time here, for example) or enter the country intending to commit crimes or carry out terrorist attacks.

Last week, the DWP released a report by the Huron Consulting Group that clearly demonstrated what the experts and city leaders who crafted Measure B over the last year knew before they placed it on the ballot: Wisely investing in renewable energy sources now would require a very slight increase in electricity rates ($1.05 a month or less), meaning that DWP rates would continue to be the lowest in the region while L.A. produces more solar energy than any other U.S. city.
In addition to the investigations surrounding the jails, federal authorities have two other inquiries involving the Sheriff's Department. Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice's civil rights division announced a broad "pattern and practice" investigation into allegations that deputies in the Antelope Valley discriminated against minority residents who receive government housing assistance. Also last month, The Times reported that a Sheriff's Department captain had been put on leave after federal agents suspected hearing her voice on a wiretap of a suspected Compton drug ring.
Fujita pledged "a significant amount of money" to the pay-for-performance and bounty pool during the 2009 playoffs as a member of the Saints, according to the league findings.
The bulk of this money would go for construction on underused city lots or land near transit lines. This emphasis should reward the Bay Area where land-use policies promote housing near bus and rail lines, but lack the public subsidies to make it happen. There is also money for home-ownership programs, multifamily apartments, farmworker housing and homeless shelters. A prior housing bond, totaling $2.1 billion, is nearly spent, creating the need for a fresh source of money to continue state housing programs.
Early in the film Aguilera belts "Something's Got a Hold on Me," commanding the screen and setting the tone for the movie. Amazing voice.

Some 75 to 100 young people were involved in numerous fights along Liberty Avenue, one of the township’s main streets, and on nearby roads, police said.

Several observers said that in meetings, Wu would wander off onto subjects that grabbed his fancy. But Tippens made sure to follow up on whatever concerns a visitor had. Separately, three sources jokingly used the same phrase in saying that she worked for him for so long because she had Stockholm syndrome, a reference to the sympathy victims can feel for their captors.

Now Bechdel does herself one better with a tender and wide-ranging examination of her relationship with her living mother, an actress and critic with a crisp surface and an intricate interior. Lacking "Fun Home's" high profile melodrama, "Are You My Mother?" is all the more erudite, subtle and charming. Its cool, elegant drawings are rendered in black, white and many shades of gray. Decades of drawing a syndicated comic strip have distilled Bechdel's skills to depict mood, thought and event in the shifting body language of her figures. But here the images have become more complex and visually interesting. While this book is definitely written, the drawings and the text are inextricable and mutually illuminating.

House Republican leaders decided on the strategy after repeatedly trying and failing to garner enough votes to pass their own, long-term transportation plan. That effort ran into opposition from tea-party conservatives, who say transportation programs should be paid for entirely by user fees such as federal gas and diesel taxes, even though revenue from those taxes isn't enough to cover current transportation spending. Conservatives also would like to see the federal role in transportation dramatically reduced, with states picking up those responsibilities. However, moderate Republicans from suburban districts don't want transportation spending cut and complained about the bill's treatment of transit programs.

This is either the product of idle minds or something a little more brilliant than that, but I have a friend who has come up with something called the Fan Suffering Index.

Recent reports of Claiborne's low Wonderlic exam score have created only a blip on his pre-draft radar screen. He's still expected to be the first cornerback taken and is widely regarded as a top 10 pick.

A majority of our readers, 57 percent, said: All translations and versions should be widely available. Michael Friedson noted that this is really a political statement. You can't have "heretical versions unless there is an official version." Fortunately, we live in one of the world's freest societies. Anybody can write a Bible translation and publish it. There is no government authorized edition. Even in something as common as our understanding of Genesis 1:1, a very different translation had been emerging over the last 60 years.
Early on in her junior season Menchella said she could see a difference in her play. She was a step ahead and felt more fluid. She began to see the entire field and to know where her teammates would be when she attacked the cage.
Pryce: I've played Hamlet and Macbeth, and had no desire to do 'The Tempest.' It's not my favorite play. But I always thought one day I would do Lear. I've played Edgar in 1973 and some of the press in London, when they reviewed 'Caretaker,' alluded to my playing Lear, saying that this was Lear-like. So it appealed to my vanity. I decided, yes, I should do Lear. And that coincided with people asking me to do it.

An obvious source of inspiration lies in 17th- and 18th-century European botanical prints, which are often bizarre and stylized but always highly colored. Kanevsky's other references are more personal and obscure. He cites Harvard University's glass-flower collection at its Museum of Natural History as an inexhaustible cache of ideas, for form, content and sheer brazen originality. Carl Fabergé's flowers set in rock-crystal vases (less well known than the eggs) are another. "They are very poetic, just simple flowers, almost weeds," Kanevsky says. "I try to create this kind of effect in my work too, with something humble like a dandelion."

Cairo's meats will be crafted in an isolated 800-square-foot space with science-lab-like cold rooms and a hot-and-humid "incubator" used to develop the tangy flavor of some traditional salamis such as Genoa and fennel seed-flecked finocchiona with the aid of a powdered lactobacillus culture. Although most of the production will be unseen by restaurant patrons, one curing room will be visible through a window behind a 16-seat restaurant counter topped by a 12-foot-long cold case (similar to the case at a sushi bar) full of finished product. Another 16 seats will run along a banquette parallel to the counter.

He was staying at the Hilton, where Obama eventually would stay, said the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

The report dismisses the campus administration's rationale for dispersing the camp and urges appeasement.

I never met the man. In a quirky, tragic bit of irony, he dropped dead from a heart attack or some other physical anomaly when I was only a baby.

“Today is a new day for Sacramento and a defining moment for our community,” Johnson said. “We came to Orlando needing to convert both ends of a one-and-one free throw.

The former Blazers star said if he were Miller, he'd tell Roy: "You got a problem with me? This is coming straight. We can do this. We can do this anywhere we want to do it. If you're talking about me, say my name. You got a problem, come to me."
America is embarrassingly obese, and it begins with our children. As the article indicates, a third of our country's children are overweight or obese. Therefore, a new policy has been added to the purpose of the CNA: curbing obesity. The problem is that Congress is too focused on changes to nutritional guidelines. Rather, it should become aware that eating in moderation is the key, too. Eating too much food, even if it is healthy, can be a catalyst to obesity. Unfortunately, children eat more than they need to; and, it is due to a lack of control and nutritional education. A policy to educate and control how much a student should eat would have significant effects, including healthier students, efficient use of American tax dollars, and less obesity in America.

For an art exhibition, designers affiliated with the University of Toronto's architecture school arrayed 104 sensors in floral patterns on a green taffeta blanket, linking them with soft conductive material. The sensors relay moment-by-moment data about their orientation; the information goes to a processor and then wirelessly to a computer, which creates a 3-D rendering of the fabric's surface. One potential application is monitoring fitful sleepers, and the designers are brainstorming with medical engineers about ways to deploy "the blanket with an I.P. address" in hospitals.

"It's a new day and a new age in the game of hockey," Hawks forward Patrick Kane said. "Sometimes the best play is the shot on net rather than the extra pass. The biggest thing with (Smith) is to try and get some traffic, try to get shots on net off the rush and try to go to the net for rebounds. You see a lot of the goals we've scored they've either been throwing pucks at the net or tip-ins or defections or rebounds. That's probably the success you're going to have on a guy like Smith."

The fact is that single-gender schools -- public as well as faith-based and independent -- have a long history and will continue to be an educational option for many children; these schools provide us with opportunities unaddressed by the authors of "Pseudoscience." They fairly criticize those who recommend sweeping educational reforms in response to modest or unsubstantiated evidence; indeed, they provide a useful public service by highlighting the dangers of shaping a single-sex classroom in response to small or debatable differences between the genders. However, there are many real and substantial differences between girls and boys that can shape their education in a meaningful way. Here is what we know: Girls lead boys in a variety of language skills, and boys outperform girls in spatial skills, mechanical reasoning, and engagement in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) careers.

After all, Epstein put an end to the curse - and cursing - in Boston by guiding the Red Sox to World Series championships in 2004 and 2007. The Red Sox had gone 86 years without capturing a World Series until Epstein ended the torment.
Once a year, Orange County chefs gather to turn the taco-themed charity fundraiser into an opportunity to create concoctions that are, well, wild and crazy. Off the beaten culinary path, the "tacos'' this year were filled with everything from alligator to lamb shanks, steak tartar to duck "fries" (yes, duck testicles).

The governor's contention is that without a session of its own, the thorny issue of gambling is likely to become intertwined with the budget — threatening a repeat of the legislative meltdown that occurred at the end of the regular session, when Miller pushed casino legislation despite resistance in the House.

Miu Miu's revamp is important to the future of Prada SpA, which owns shoe brands Car Shoe and Church's in addition to Miu Miu and Prada. Prada's owners—Ms. Prada and her husband Patrizio Bertelli, who is chief executive—hope to list Prada on the stock market in the coming years.

"Recent Tragic Events": Originally produced at Woolly Mammoth Theatre in Washington, D.C., a company cited by Third Rail as a model, it was named a finalist for the American Theatre Critics New Play Award. The play deals with the aftermath of the tragedy of Sept. 11, but in a way only Wright might have conceived -- as a comedy about faith and predestination, played out through a blind date in Minneapolis that somehow involves a visit from Joyce Carol Oates as a sock puppet. Third Rail's February 2005 production instantly put the new company on the Portland theater map, earning five Drammy Awards.

"We've got a country with a very Anglo-Saxon food heritage, except for this exciting enclave in Wellington," said Lauraine Jacobs, a New Zealand cookbook writer and Cuisine food editor. Locals generally agree that Wellington's foodie reputation began when small groups of immigrants from Italy (fisherman from the Sicilian island of Stromboli in the 1890s) and Greece (after World War I) happened to settle near Wellington, bringing along their mothers' recipes and espresso machines. In the 1950s, coffee bars (unlike pubs or restaurants) were allowed to stay open until early in the morning, playing jazz, supported by the new population of Jewish refugees — artists, musicians, professionals — who arrived during World War II. Since then, the flavor of Wellington has been set: international, Mediterranean, coffee-obsessed.

The Haitians who moved said they were promised factory jobs and houses. But there were no real jobs in the area, and many of the tentlike shelters collapsed in the first hard rain. When Rolling Stone magazine mentioned the controversy in an article critical of Haitian relief efforts, Penn bristled in a letter to the editor that ran more than 7,000 words. "What those not in the field do not know is that 100 or more tents go down in EVERY camp with EVERY harsh rain," he wrote.

Radical Rick Santorum is too stupid to realize, as he runs for parson-in-chief, that we all pray to the same God. It is only the manner in which the prayer is conducted and the institutional catechism of the various theologies that differ. But these differences are superficial.

Mexico's original take-out food, tamales (singular: tamal) developed in pre-Hispanic Mexico and became more sophisticated with the Spanish introduction of pork and other ingredients. Today, tamales show up as both walk-away snacks and elaborate fiesta delicacies, and like all Mexican cuisine, they vary widely by region and family tradition. The most popular rellenos (fillings) are pork and cheese, but might be anything from fish to iguana, augmented by pumpkin, pineapple rice or peanuts, and tucked into a blanket of yellow, black or purple corn dough called masa. They may be baked, steamed or grilled in a jacket of dried corn husks or fresh corn or banana leaves. Sometimes tamales are even wrapped in palm, avocado or leaves of chaya (a spinach-like vegetable).

Since then I've had the pleasure of learning much about Nathan's convictions. Some are consistent with liberal politics; some are consistent with conservative politics. Some I agree with exactly; others I do not agree with at all. In each case, I found Nathan to be thoughtful and respectful. Does that suggest he is too compromising, as you have suggested? In the time I have known him, I have never seen him capitulate on his values. He respectfully disagrees and seeks a common understanding, a skill I wish more of our civic leaders possessed. Can he make the hard decisions necessary to govern? Those who have considered the totality of his honorable military service, his record in the state Assembly, and his personal capabilities have concluded that he is exactly the kind of clear, calm and decisive leader we need as mayor. He showed this decisiveness when he moved to independence. Did he damage his fellows by electing to become independent? By my estimation, the political parties exist to serve the voters and the candidates. I'm not sure when the notion that we serve them became relevant.

How did director Story and screenwriters Keith Merryman and David A. Newman ("Friends With Benefits") squeeze an enjoyable film out of this? By retaining Harvey's archetypes but getting creative about humanizing the people wearing the labels. The guys consist of the Player (Romany Malco), the Mama's Boy (Terrence J), the Dreamer (Michael Ealy), the Non-Committer (Jerry Ferrara), the Happily Married Guy (Gary Owen) and the Happily Divorced Guy (Kevin Hart). Their ladies, former, current and future, break down into equally slick headlines.

"It would make it that much tougher to win the West," Rivers said this week on San Diego's XX 1090 radio. "All the sudden, at least from a media's perspective, it would become a division that's not lost in the shuffle like it's been in years past. I kind of hope that that's the case just because it's always fun to play a Peyton Manning-led football team. To play him twice a year that would be a battle like crazy to win the division. I hope it happens. One thing you know about him, he's going to be thorough and make the best decision for him that gives him the best chance to go win.

But look at this way: The last time the Broncos won a championship, Manning was a rookie. John Elway wants to get his mitts on the Lombardi Trophy again while franchise owner Pat Bowlen is young enough to enjoy it. Wouldn't you also say the Broncos are more serious title contenders now than three months ago?

Principally I feared the bogeymen with ugly, leering faces who slunk in the shadowy yard and camped in the dark corner of the basement behind the furnace where they hissed and growled.

As he spoke, I set aside the legal pad I been jotting down occasional notes on and just began to listen. It was easily the most remarkable story I had heard in 25 years as a journalist. It was also a story that I would soon learn would perhaps never be written. Jimmy was scared. He called me a few weeks later and told me to drop it. He was worried what people would think of him. “Buddy had a lot of friends,” he explained. “What are they going to think?” He was also worried that he would find himself in jeopardy with the law. I told him I understood. I did not hear from him until a year later, when he called me up and told me he was ready. When the profile I wrote of him appeared in the Daily News in June 2006, the fears he had were washed away by a flood of supportive emails. When I spoke with him later, it was as if an anvil had been lifted from his back.

We'll see what they do. Snead and Fishger have three picks in the second round, and then go again at No. 65 overall (early in the third round.) That gives them an opportunity to plug in several roster gaps. Again, they have so many glaring weaknesses, that I can't really growl about where they decide to go in the second round and third round as long as they come up with good players who can start early in their careers.

Often, they said, girlfriends who become annoyed by their fugitive boyfriends will help break a case.

"Whitney" (9:30 p.m., KGW, 9/22): Whitney Cummings co-created the promising "2 Broke Girls." But here she plays a comedy version of herself, and things don't go so well. The idea, apparently, is to explore the "happily unmarried" state of Whitney and her boyfriend, Alex (Chris D'Elia).

Wyden is in an uncomfortable place these days. Republicans discuss him with satisfied surprise while many Democrats bounce between incredulous and angry. The harshest assessments suggest he is giving aid and comfort to the enemy. Even sympathizers question his thinking and election-year timing.

"There's Something About Mary" (1998): Usually cited as the Farrelly brothers' best movie (though some of us have a soft spot for "Kingpin"), the story follows Ted (Ben Stiller), who has long loved Mary (Cameron Diaz). He gets another shot at dating her 13 years after a hilariously disastrous prom date. But Healy (Matt Dillon), the private detective Ted hires to follow Mary, falls for her, too. What makes the movie work is the stars' willingness to do anything for a laugh; think of the hair-gel scene for proof.

Of course, tasting the wines from the barrel offers a snapshot of a vintage and it is always unwise to generalize. But from the wines I tasted, the appellations of Pomerol, Pauillac and Saint-Julien have made good wines, with some châteaux producing exceptional examples.

Now, the foundation to any great pizza is the crust, so the next step was developing the dough. A good crust has to set up and bake quickly in a hot oven, it should be crisp on the outside but tender and slightly chewy on the inside. And it has to carry good flavor without drawing too much attention to itself. The best pizza crusts are the ones you notice only after you're done eating.

But the Jets weren’t ready. Last January, the Jets seemed to come up with the game plan for slowing Brady, loading up the field with enough defensive backs to clog his throwing lanes. Clearly, the Patriots quarterback has adjusted: He completed 26 of 39 passes for three touchdowns and a 118.4 passer rating, and did that on a night when he missed several throws he’d normally make in the first half.
Gallagher said Cleveland should pay for the work, since the crosswalk would be on a city road. But Ross said Cleveland can't afford it.

Strangely, no pressure whatsoever is being exerted on Ron Paul to pull out of the race, despite the stronger evidence that, with his narrow if vocal constituency, he has no chance of being nominated. It is generally acknowledged that his real objective is to give libertarianism a toehold in the GOP that someday, somehow may grow to greater influence.

"Being in the front I really didn't feel much," Centrowitz told USA Track & Field. "The only time it got real physical was with 500 meters to go and I came on the inside and had to give a little nudge, but other than that it wasn't crazy for me."

The ritual includes a visit to the local pub, where Luxton usually does several uncharacteristic things: He buys his son a pint; and he shows off the medal to anyone who asks to see it. But on this day, the father drives past the pub. Jack realizes, a little too late, that his father has meant for Jack to take the initiative and invite him to the pub, giving him, by this small yet fraught gesture, a sign that his son is ready not just to continue the tradition but to start taking care of his father and to take over the farm after his father's death.

The concern for Chen – really, for anyone who has pitched exclusively as a pro in Japan – is how he adjusts to pitching every fifth day instead of every sixth. The Orioles were careful to spread out his starts early, but he threw on four days rest Sunday. That likely will be the norm for much of the rest of the season. So far, so good. But it is a long year, and pitching so often can be a huge challenge.

Sentimental attachment to the turnpike aside, there is real debate as to whether now is the time for Ohio to be trying to unload the toll road.

The Tuscan-inspired food, crafted by Rodrigo da Silva, supports that feeling. It's straightforward and delicious, bringing in strong Italian reference points without hitting customers over the head. Florentine steak, for example, is what diners will find all over Tuscany; it's a huge T-bone - actually a porterhouse because the tenderloin is so large - with perfect grill marks encased in a glistening glaze of olive oil. It's placed on the plate with a wedge of lemon, and da Silva sprinkles lemon-dressed arugula leaves over the top.
Dimora's forfeiture trial was scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. today, after an earlier postponement, but was recessed before it began.

Quiñonez, 25, gambled with her life eight months ago by returning to her native Mexico. It was a frightening step she had to take so she eventually could live legally in the United States with her citizen husband, Juan Evangelista, and 2½-year-old son, Aidan. She went through nearly half a year of anguished waiting in Mexico. But she is now a green-card-carrying legal resident of the United States.

His book about the murders masterminded by Charles Manson, "Helter Skelter," written with coauthor Curt Gentry, hasn't been out of print since it appeared in 1974. It's blurbed as the bestselling true-crime book of all time, at what Bugliosi figures is about 7 million copies. His 2007 JFK book, "Reclaiming History," got its start in a 1986 mock trial on television, in which Bugliosi prosecuted Lee Harvey Oswald, using actual assassination witnesses, and proved that Oswald alone killed the president. It has sold considerably fewer copies than "Helter Skelter," but, as he says, "if you want to make money, you don't put out a book that weighs 7 1/2 pounds and costs $57 and has over 10,000 citations and a million and a half words."

HOPE FOR THE FUTURE
The case: Batiste of Sacramento filed suit after claiming she was harassed and abused - and eventually menaced by a gun-wielding collector - after she fell behind in debt payments. Court papers indicate she borrowed $68,065 from American General Finance, securing the loan with a 2003 Ford Mustang and 2005 GMC Denali. The company claimed she never made a single payment. The delinquent debt went to collections and the Mustang was repossessed. Batiste, who is African American, accused one alleged AGF representative of using racial slurs and vulgar language "as well as a threat of violence" to locate the second car. According to the suit, fliers were distributed in Batiste's neighborhood with her full name, offering a cash reward for information leading to the current location of the Denali. At one point, the suit states, a man with a handgun confronted her at her second home in Las Vegas, seeking the second vehicle.

If the finger-thick asparagus from the Sacramento Delta is in season, you may see it over the course of a week simply roasted and served with ricotta, hazelnuts and a touch of lemon zest; sliced thin and tossed into a custard on a savory breakfast brioche; and tossed with tagliatelle and crunchy bits of pancetta in a springtime take on carbonara, crowned with a runny poached egg. You can judge the seriousness of a certain kind of Los Angeles restaurant not just from the date on which it begins to serve asparagus but also by when it shifts from thin to thick.

The city and the county have similar economic development programs. Both are run by quasi-governmental agencies - the city has its St. Louis Development Corp., the county, its Economic Council - with professional staffs to manage day-to-day programs and citizen boards to vote on big matters. Both are legally separate from their county governments, but their top staff serve at the pleasure of Mayor Francis Slay and County Executive Charlie Dooley, respectively, and most of their board members are political appointees. Both have sub-agencies to oversee land assemblage, industrial development bonds and other tools of the economic development trade. Both run a port authority.

London theater has also long been a cultural standby for travelers and Londoners alike. It used to be cheap. No longer, with a few exceptions (see If You Go box). London's mainstream West End theaters bristle with long-running musicals like "The Lion King" (12 years and counting at the Lyceum Theatre), whodunits like the Agatha Christie warhorse "The Mousetrap" (a staggering world record 60 years at St. Martin's Theatre) and revivals such as Harold Pinter's 1978 broken-marriage drama "Betrayal."

It's important for me to compose honest, sincere music that connects with the music that is produced spontaneously by our culture. I hate the term "pop" music because for many it has pejorative undertones - implying that it is intrinsically superficial, lacking in depth or subtlety. The reality is that the body of music with wide appeal (i.e. "pop") is diverse - from forgettable ditties to sublime masterpieces. I feel that when a tune reaches iconic status - when it enters our lexicon of discourse - then it is giving voice to something that resonates strongly with us, something that speaks to and for us, reveals who we are without pretense.

It's hard for me to talk about this, harder still to write about it, because I want everyone to know only what I loved about my dad. It feels disloyal to acknowledge this part of him and shameful to admit that this is part of my legacy.

øNetworking. Lots of people hate events where they have to strike up a conversation with strangers or people they don't know well. Sobel says it's easier if you begin by asking "low-risk, innocuous" questions such as "How long have you worked here?" or "Where did you grow up?" The point, he says, is to make people feel like you're interested in a connection through your questions and careful listening.

I'd had a rougher version of that thought myself, which is not to suggest I belong in a sentence with Debussy.

The walleye fishing around the Western Basin has been slow this week, but is heating up with the calmer waters and warmer temperatures. Some walleye are still being caught on lead-head, hair-skirted jigs with stinger hooks on the reefs, but most of the post-spawn walleye are now moving to deeper waters off the reefs. Trolling fishermen have been doing well with minnow-style plugs and spinner rigs tipped with nightcrawlers off the main reef complex, and in deeper waters west of the Bass Islands.

The April 18 Post-Dispatch editorial " 'Totalitarian incursion'" says, "Contraception is nowhere in the Bible," apparently in an effort to challenge the rationale underlying the sacred beliefs of the Catholic Church. No need to enter that debate. The validity of the premise is irrelevant. In this nation, no religious organization is required to substitute the beliefs of the Post-Dispatch for its own. Neither is it required to succumb to the beliefs of the majority. That is the beauty of constitutionally protected freedom.

But frankly Banderas was too busy to have much time to worry, quickly landing important parts in “Philadelphia,” “Interview With the Vampire” and “Evita.” Later, “The Mask of Zorro” and Robert Rodriguez’s wild Western “Desperado” not only provided leads, but the chance for Banderas to wink, just a little, at his on-screen image.

The elections will be the country's first since its economic crisis began in late 2009. In October 2009, the Socialists swept to power under George Papandreou; he was forced to step aside after some two years in office during a political crisis that raised doubts about the country's future in the euro zone. Since November, Mr. Papademos has headed an interim government—backed by the country's two main parties—whose mandate is to oversee the ratification and implementation of the country's latest bailout.

"While there are great museum collections," Friede said, "most of the great material in our time was still in private hands and most people didn't care that much" about the art of New Guinea. "African art had the endorsement of having inspired Cubism, while Oceanic art was aligned with the Surrealists. So it became imaginable that one could create a definitive collection."

TR: It's good for me now. I have a really good feel for it now. It's more of an out pitch, I think. But it's something that I definitely want to have that I can flip in 2-0. Not only flip it in there, but be effective with it and possibly induce some groundballs when I can with it. For me right now, it's something that I throw under the zone more now than in the zone. That isn't a bad thing because I won't get hurt there. But I want to have the feel for the in-the-zone one and the out-of-the-zone one. Right now it's basically out of the zone for me.

Here's just one example: The tightening of controls on the border began in the 1990s, and it was suppose supposed to deter illegal immigration. But the border controls had just the opposite effect.

For this venture, Kapur is spreading his wings after eight years working under Mazzola and Oakes. He soars, even on the simplest item like Green Goddess salad ($11), a study in cucumbers inspired by the classic dressing, kissed with avocado, basil, anchovy and a caper vinaigrette. The vegetables are ice-cold and chunked, sliced and shaved, each of which brings out a different facet. It's a brilliant marriage of fine ingredients and inspired technique, as is just about everything else on the contemporary American menu.

The translation: Rutgers and UConn could well be in the mix to round out a conference that could easily have two eight-team divisions. We'll call one "The North," since North and South would only be too perfect for the ACC's geographic football. The North could look like this: Maryland, Virginia Tech, Virginia, Boston College, Syracuse, Pitt, Rutgers and UConn. Pretty tidy, eh? (Oh, and the South would be North Carolina, Duke, Wake Forest, N.C. State, Georgia Tech, Miami, Florida State and Clemson.)

What makes "Rebirth of a Nation" so readable -- beyond the author's writerly facility -- and saves it from a descent into didacticism is Lears' skillful mining of original cultural references and his strikingly drawn portraits. This is particularly true of figures a reader already imagines knowing -- Oliver Wendell Holmes or Williams Jennings Bryan, for example -- and, especially, the great financiers. The concise portrait of the dominant Wall Street figure of the age, J.P. Morgan, is extremely well-rendered, as is the simple encapsulation of his all-transforming financial system, "Morganization," which essentially was the shift of a company's equity from interest-paying bonds to stocks that depend on earnings. (Unlike credit default swaps, it was a financial innovation that worked.)

With Thursday’s win, the Oil Kings improved to 8-0 at home in the playoffs. “We feel as a staff here we’ve got to play better (in Game 2), so we expect a bigger effort out of our group,” Laxdal said. “Obviously, to get that first win tonight, we can settle down a little bit. We know there’s going to be a push tomorrow night, and we have to push ourselves. I thought a lot of our passes were a little bit wobbly and the crispness wasn’t there. That’s something I know for our young group, we haven’t been this far in the playoffs, and they (the Winterhawks) have been, so you saw a little bit of nerves. But I thought we did a good job of defending and, obviously, we wanted to get the first win, and we got that tonight.”
Positions: McCarthy wants to create a housing trust fund for affordable family housing and focus on improving schools so parents will choose public education over private education. She wants to create more open space in the district and tap private funds for those projects.

Clark's death at age 82 was a sad communal moment for most of us in the nonshowbiz world -- many remembered him from hosting "American Bandstand" and ushering in the New Year, every year, for what seemed like forever -- he was Father Time and Baby New Year wrapped into one age-defying package. But for Gloria Poole, now 56 and living in San Ramon (Gary Poole passed away in 1989), it was far more personal.

The final screen offered travel insurance and a branded credit card but only hinted that checked-baggage fees "may" apply. Only by opening a pop-up window did I learn that I would have to fork over $25 each way for the first checked bag and $35 each way for the second. There's no way to automatically factor that into the price of the ticket for an inclusive fare. If I want to buy something else, such as a meal, there's no place on the booking screen for that, either.

For this, credit the surrounding cloud forest, a specific variety of tropical or subtropical ecosystem that occurs at just the right mix of altitude — Mindo's valley varies from 4,500 to 8,000 feet — cloud cover, sunlight, mild temperatures and moisture. Rainfall here averages 5 feet or more per year.

Many liberals denigrated the 1957 act. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., however, supported it.

That might even be Windows Phone's defining concept. Again, you might not agree with this idea. The iPhone, and Android phones, just extend the standard PC metaphor into handheld devices.

And then my agent represents the woman who runs the school and saw that I was an understudy. And then she asked the woman who runs the school, "Is she good? Let me meet with her." That's how everything happened. ...

There’s also the great Southern storytelling tradition that rises up from the dinner table, often from sheer necessity. In big cities, Foose explains, there’s so much to do. “Down here, we just have each other to entertain ourselves — by cooking, or talking about what we’re going to cook next, or what someone else has cooked. It’s part of our entertainment as much as it is just the necessity of having to cook and eat.”

Ngu Binh This is a fantasyland for fetishists of subtle textures.

In office, Mr. Obama has become a reluctant realist — less focused on the grand visions and hopes of his campaign, more on the immediate foreign policy chores of keeping America safe. And on Afghanistan specifically, no metamorphosis was needed. From the beginning of his presidential campaign, Barack Obama had made it clear that he viewed the Afghanistan conflict as the correct war to pursue in the aftermath of Sept. 11. He pledged to swing focus from Iraq to Afghanistan and often spoke of adding at least two brigades of U.S. combat forces to the latter mission, as the Taliban regained strength during the second term of the Bush presidency.

Tourism, of course, is the lifeblood of Easter Island, yet there are concerns about just how many visitors the island's delicate archeological treasures can handle. Many indigenous Rapa Nui believe their way of life is at risk and are pushing for more control over the way the island is run. Some believe that Chile has excluded them from the decision-making process and from the profits flowing from the tourism industry. Just a few weeks after my visit, tensions flared up over a planned $50-million hotel project in Hanga Roa. Members of a local clan, who claim the hotel grounds as part of their ancestral lands, staged a series of sit-ins until forced to leave by Chilean police earlier this year.

“There’s this pressure to kind of stay at a certain stage of development and not grow any older,” she says. “It’s in the culture everywhere, not just in show business, and it’s very troubling and stultifying to the spirit, I think.

Role model: "I consider my grandfather, Pete Ekern, as a role model. He just retired at age 78 from his family medical practice in Mexico, Mo. He played football at Mizzou in the 1950s, and he is a true example of a Mizzou Tiger. He always puts others above himself, always provides words to reflect upon, and his quick wit can liven any situation. He has touched so many lives. He is a selfless person and a great role model."

Cage's music holds the ear's attention at first, but with no beginning, middle or end, it's all middle, all ambience, and doesn't go deeper than the first couple of minutes. It has no urgency, no personality. A single note or noise is an event, incapable of development. Very in the moment.

"Bachelor Party" (1984): Tom Hanks plays the bachelor of the title, whose friends throw him a big party; disaster ensues. It's sort of like a lesser precursor of "The Hangover," not nearly as funny. Still, Hanks is Hanks, and he brings his dopey school-bus driver character a lot of charm. If you want to remember what middling '80s sex comedies are like, this is a pretty good example.

Mike Lupica, New York Daily News: "Understand something: The overturning of Braun's 50-game suspension doesn't mean Braun is clean, no matter what he says or how many times he says it or what he expects reasonable people to believe. He wasn't exonerated. He was acquitted. There's a difference. So Braun of the Brewers becomes the first positive test to win this kind of appeal in baseball. So he goes on with his career now, and his huge contract, no suspension, because a triple-sealed sample, one that no one ever suggested had been tampered with, didn't make the last FedEx shipment on a weekend, didn't go out until Monday morning. If you want to think justice was served, have at it."
It's concerning, though, that the same winter survey that revealed such a favorable crab population also found a significant drop in mature female crabs. There are any number of possible explanations for this — the 2010 spawn was poor so the population began as a smaller number, and the mild temperatures may have caused them to overwinter in shallow areas or other places that scientists don't survey.

Spurs 87, Jazz 81: Manu Ginobili broke out of his shooting slump with 17 points to lead visiting San Antonio to a sweep of the first-round series. ... Ginobili was 0-for-8 from beyond the arc in the first three games of the series.

If you have caviar or truffles languishing on your counter, by all means use them for garnish. I usually use just a couple of pinches of minced fines herbes (a mix of any or all of parsley, tarragon, chervil and chives, varying according to what I have on hand). And I have to say that, in a pinch, a good grinding of cracked black pepper cuts the richness deliciously.

Question: I took a trip to Las Vegas last month on Spirit Airlines. The tickets were expensive, but I didn't have time to book ahead of time. What upset me, though, is that the airline charged me $40 each way for carry-on luggage, which was stored overhead. Isn't this an abuse by the airline?

A 10 year perspective: Maryland's approved budget in 2003 was $22.5 billion; 2013 the approved budget is $34.9 billion, a 55 percent increase over the past 10 years. The population has increased from 5.5 million to 5.8 million, a 9.4 percent increase. Inflation is 2 percent per year. So 10 years later we are spending $12 billion more annually, far exceeding any rational justification. Hardly doomsday.

To be fair, the visuals are stunning -- head shots decorate the drab brown landscape in rich red and brain-colored hues -- and the portability of Chris and Sheva's armory is impressive.

District Judge Peter Sheridan noted that there is not much guidance on this issue. Nevertheless, Judge Sheridan did indicate that “the policy behind the provision envinces an intent to deter the abuse of life estates within the transfer of asset rules”. Judge Sheridan denied Mr. Traister’s application for the preliminary injunction. This case is still pending before the Federal District Court. This federal court decision demonstrates the reluctance of courts to allow the life estate transaction where the individual has not lived at the property for at least one year from the date of the purchase of the life estate interest as required by federal statute.
The first witness to take the stand was Pierce County Sheriff's Detective Gary Sanders, who described how investigators found the images and then displayed them for jurors, explaining what they were seeing in each one.

A: Yup, you don't want to go back to the Garden, where they've re-loaded the confetti bins. Wednesday will offer some insight into whether the Heat are as focused as they were through the opening three rounds last season, when they didn't allow a series to go beyond five games.

Chuck took the microphone and shouted out Sylvia Robinson, Farrakhan, and Occupy Wall Street, condemned Arizona politics and the execution of Troy Davis, and spoke out against America's wars. These may not have been be your issues, but that hardly mattered: you were looking at a man with convictions and dedication (and music) to back them up. The old emcee still knows what so many have forgotten for art's sake: If you've got a microphone or an instrument plugged into a speaker, if you've got an audience willing to listen, don't waste the gift. You've got the expressive power of human language open to you: say something. And damn the game if it don't mean nothing.

The problem is the execution. Even with a playful premise, John Orloff's screenplay and Roland Emmerich's direction never lift the production above a tired heaviness, a we've-seen-all-this-before predictability. "Anonymous" ends up being a kind of homage lost in a period piece. It lacks a true protagonist and a true antagonist. The fact that it bops around willy-nilly in time is the least of its problems.

That fact, along with other lines of evidence, helps overthrow some widely held notions on the roots of creativity. Contrary to popular belief — to say nothing of scads of books that have "right brain" in the title — it appears that the right hemisphere is not the only side responsible for making people artistic.
When Jeter crossed the plate after his historic hit — a home run — it was Posada who first hugged him at home plate. When Rivera recorded his record-breaking 602nd save — passing Trevor Hoffman for the lead — it was Posada who pushed the Yankees closer back to the pitcher’s mound to receive a warm ovation.

In some disasters, authorities have rushed to dispose of bodies—sometimes in mass graves the size of football fields—citing fears that the corpses could spread disease or damage the psyche of survivors if left visible. But there is little risk of epidemics spread by corpses after disasters, global health officials say, in part because pathogens don't survive long in dead bodies.
“What we said toward the end of the season when we lost some games but were working on some things,” Dwyane Wade said, “was when it comes to our spacing, when it comes to our rotations, who was in the ball game, our ball movement … we were getting better even though it wasn’t resulting in as many wins.
It's important to take a page from the president's debt commission, chaired by former senator Alan Simpson and former White House chief of staff Erksine Bowles, which called for reducing the deficit over the next 10 years by about $4 trillion. I believe that number is achievable. We have already cut the first trillion in August when we raised the debt limit. Now we need to look for another $3 trillion.
Enter British author Alison Weir's new biography, "Mary Boleyn: The Mistress of Kings." Mary is not as famous as her sister Anne, who became the second wife of King Henry VIII.

Meanwhile, five years after the crisis hit, the U.K. is in the midst of the biggest squeeze on living standards in modern history, with output still well below its peak, weak-to-non-existent growth, a deteriorating debt profile, and inflation so far above target the BOE may no longer have scope to deploy its sole policy tool. But don't worry: In two years, inflation will be back below 2% and the economy will be ticking along nicely, growing by 3%. At least, that's what the model says.
EARTH-DAY RELATED EVENTS
The visitors snapped the scoreless deadlock at 6:41 of the second period on a power play. Michael Del Zotto's left-point drive pinballed off several players on the way to Holtby, and Callahan was in the right place to swat home the rebound from atop the crease.
to know what kind of a guy Gary Carter was? Biggest knock on him was that he was such a good guy that he couldn't be for real. ‘I try to emphasize what's good in life,' Carter once said. ‘The Lord, playing ball, my family, meeting people and good health.' And he meant it. He lived as good, if not better, a life than he talked. Gary Carter was there for whatever fans, media and teammates needed, whenever they needed it. He wasn't looking for anything in return. It was the only way he knew to act."

In the suburbs, the homeless are more dispersed and harder to find. They camp in rural areas — along creek beds, in wooded areas, in culverts — making them harder to detect and subsequently harder to help. Most community parks and open spaces are closed overnight.

Anyone who has been to the Pride Parade can attest to the potential for unruliness.

Round out the drink with something sweet. Simple syrup (equal parts water and sugar heated until clear, then cooled) is traditional, but honey is splendid. Agave nectar (similar to honey) and maple syrup also are nice. For quantity, you'll need to experiment, but if you like it sweet, use as much sweetener as alcohol.

Kilbane tales abound. Seated for a deposition, he and a hostile expert once leaned on opposite sides of a glass tabletop and traded glares. The glass cracked. Shards flew. The lawyer kept grilling. The witness began to sweat. He gradually took off his jacket and tie, unbuttoned his shirt, asked for a bathroom break and fled to the airport, never to testify.
While most residents dismiss the likelihood that Fairview will become a Graceland-like attraction, many wondered what even a modest contingent of curious fans will mean to their quiet community.
Deen's main mantra is moderation. You can have that bacon-doughnut burger, the idea goes, as long as you accompany it with a side of pills to counter the effects of this egregiously unhealthy meal. Deen's personal lifestyle changes include cutting down on her sweet tea intake, taking to the treadmill and signing a lucrative contract to promote an expensive diabetes drug.
Backs like Arian Foster — with a combination of rushing and receiving skills — are the perfect fit for the current NFL offensive landscape, but outside of the versatile Texans running back, teams are digging for the next Maurice Jones-Drew, the next Ray Rice or the next LeSean McCoy. Why? They can gain yards no matter what — even when the game plan is stacked directly against them, all three of these backs have become adept at finding holes where there are none.

That incident drives the rest of the film — allowing everyone to resurrect old gripes and grudges and figure out whom they really love. Most of the tips on the dog's whereabouts come from Carmen (Ayelet Zurer), a clairvoyant gypsy who is the caretaker of the vacation home.

After Alabama passed its law, farm workers left for other states and crops were ruined. When Arizona gained a reputation for discrimination after passing its law, the state lost an estimated $145 million in convention business. When teachers in Alabama were forced to become immigration agents, students were afraid to attend school. When cops are required to check immigration papers, they spend less time solving serious crimes. When states sanction profiling, U.S. citizens and immigrants alike get stopped and harassed.

There's nothing in-between for the college athletes. In my time, there were far more 5Ks and 10Ks and 12Ks. Now everything's going to the marathons. That's not the event's problem, that's the sport's problem.

What you will witness over the next 6 months is the rest of the story. Domonic Brown is at a pivotal point in his career with the Phillies. In some respects, you can't help but feel sorry for the kid. Charlie Manuel won't want to hear that. He's a baseball man, and baseball is all about paying your dues.

You see Chase Utley, who played in 113 games at Triple A as a 24-year-old. And, of course, you see guys like Manuel, who was 31 years old when he finally gave up on major league baseball and headed over the Pacific to play in Japan.

They had joined a community supported agriculture network that entitled them to a "share" of a local farmer's harvest, and were filling their fridge with vegetables they had never so much as blanched before: beets in their raw form, kale, turnips, kohlrabi. "I realized I wasn't even sure how to store or prepare vegetables. We had become so accustomed to foods that come in boxes that were stamped with directions," says Benjamin.

Hancock owes much of his fame to pop hits such as the hugely danceable "Chameleon," which appeared on the breakthrough 1973 fusion album "Head Hunters" (for which the band was named).

Ash-spiced venison loin is another signature dish. It plays the dark meat's complex gaminess against bitter braised radicchio and a dried cherry reduction. Everything on the plate resonates and works with every other element. The other main course that stands out is pancetta-wrapped veal loin with sweetbreads, both beautifully cooked and a great match with a stellar Chianti or Valpolicella.

The light rail tracks on Conway Street near Camden Yards are part of the course and have presented an engineering challenge. During the race, they will be covered with a mixture of asphalt and mesh, which organizers hope will hold as the race cars zoom over them. As a result, light rail service will be temporarily divided into two lines, the northern run stopping at Baltimore Street and the southern run stopping at Hamburg Street. Shuttle buses will connect the two. Baseball fans riding light rail to the Orioles-Blue Jays games a few days before the race will be deposited a few blocks farther north or south of Camden Yards than usual. (The Orioles, it seems, are doing their best to minimize the disruption this will cause by rapidly diminishing the degree of fan interest in attending games.)

Meg Linton, director of the gallery, organized the show with curatorial intern Nina Laurinolli. They came up with a roster of 28 artists from L.A. and beyond, some with deep local exposure and others with very little, who "draw, cut, film, pin, perforate, perform and journal." Material engagement is largely what unifies the group, which settles thoughtfully into clusters around notions of exuberant energy (Ann Diener, Penelope Gottlieb, Aaron Noble, Erin Marie Dunn, Emily de Araújo, Mindy Shapero), performative gesture (Barbara Berk, Takehito Koganezawa), diaristic notation (Fred Stonehouse, Tucker Neel) and the vulnerabilities of the social/political/religious status quo (Sandow Birk, Joe Biel, Eric Beltz, Richard Keely and Anna O'Cain).

Dear Margo: I'm a dual U.S./U.K. citizen in my late 20s, and I chose to move to America to pursue my career. My brother did the same. For a few years, it was fun, and I wasn't thinking too far ahead, but my brother recently married, establishing real roots over here. My mother is American and would love to come to the States, but my father has such a host of health problems that it would be financially impossible for them to move here. When we were home in England for Christmas, my brother came to me crying one night, upset that once again we were leaving them and saying that when the time comes for him and his wife to have children, our parents will only see them once, twice or three times a year at most. So I guess my problem is this: I love my life over here. I have a good job, friends I love and a boyfriend I can see myself settling down with. Do I give it all up and move back to London? Family should be the most important thing, and I feel guilty I have not prioritized it. My parents have been nothing but supportive and loving my whole life. I know it is a parent's duty to wave their children off into the world, but I don't want to regret anything when they die. I also don't want to give up a wonderful man and the life I've built here. — Confused and Guilty

Hardy that boosted the Baltimore Orioles over New York 7-1, giving Brian Matusz his first victory in 11 months and Buck Showalter his 1,000th win as a big league manager.
Ted Allen will be signing copies of "In My Kitchen" on the following dates:
Unlike previous proposals to privatize Medicare -- including one from Ryan earlier this year -- the new approach would be seeded with safeguards to guarantee minimum standards for care that would be approved by federal officials. Ryan and Wyden believe that injecting competition into the system would make Medicare nimbler and more efficient. Seniors would have more choices, they say, while market forces would lower costs.
The search is officially on for a new St. Charles Community College president.
Kasich also surely knows owning a resume that includes a crushing defeat at the hands of organized labor is hardly an asset for a Republican officeholder who still aspires to be president -- or even a governor seeking a second term in 2014.

(As a Portland aside, Greenwald writes about how VanderSloot once took out advertising criticizing stories written by Peter Zuckerman, a journalist for the Idaho Falls Post Register. Zuckerman later wrote for The Oregonian for a while and is now in a relationship with Mayor Sam Adams.)
The Black Canyon plan would have set a precedent for other federal land administrators, who could eliminate guided access for all kinds of sports, from rafting to hunting to canyoneering.
So I'll take my chances on McNabb and Adrian Peterson and Percy Harvin. I'll take my chances on new coach Leslie Frazier, figuring he's more Don Shula than David Shula. I'll take my chances on the Vikings bringing joy to Minneapolis-St. Paul and Couch Slouch, USA.

Chef Patrick Lee Warner is off on several other explorations. He's opened Scratch Cafe, a breakfast/lunch place in the downtown Portland Justice Center (1138 S.W. Third Ave., 503-224-1970), some distance geographically and culturally from Lake Oswego. It specializes in comfort entries such as pot pies, meat loaf, macaroni and cheese and sizable sandwiches, plus house-baked scones (notable maple-bacon), muffins and cookies. There's a little bit of overlap; recently, both Scratch and Scratch Cafe were offering stuffed collard greens.
Local German newspaper Oberbayerisches Volksblatt today quoted attorney Ulrich Busch as saying it was his client’s “greatest wish” to be buried in the United States where his family lives.
The literacy bill was controversial because it says the worst readers can't go from third grade to fourth grade without special permission by a school superintendent. Some chafed at the idea of a state-mandated retention policy.
Okawville coach Dave Blumhorst doesn't have a top-flight player like Rennegarbe. But he has the kind of depth that gives him a chance to win the school's first golf hardware.
The evidence is in the number of stories he tells of former patients and their IVF babies -- many in high school and college -- who come up to him at restaurants and Cleveland Browns games, or the former patient who calls him every Mother's Day to express her gratitude.

She testified that Elizabeth Edwards had known about her husband's affair with Rielle Hunter before The National Enquirer made it public. Hers was the most stirring testimony of the day at Edwards' trial on corruption charges, as prosecutors worked to build a timeline of the affair and efforts to cover it up.
YOU Docs are on record saying that for folks 50 and up, the vaccine called Pneumovax reduces inflammation that damages blood vessels and makes your brain foggy and your thinking fuzzy. Dr. Oz got this high-caliber shot when he tuned 50; so did Young Dr. Mike! Does Prevnar do the same? Probably, but frankly, preventing pneumonia and possibly reducing your risk of heart attack by 50 percent is more than enough reason for us -- and you -- to go ahead and get vaccinated. Medicare and most insurance companies cover it. If yours doesn't, SWITCH; they are demonstrating just how much they do not care about you. * * *
She said she was happy to create options for women who needed more coverage.

SAN FRANCISCO - A new federal proposal to tighten leash rules on parkland in and around San Francisco has many dog owners barking mad.
A: Working with the kids never gets old. They come here with this passion to perform. I really see it as similar to what (Motown founder) Berry Gordy was doing throughout the 1960s. We're working with rough talent, not polished or experienced talent. We're training and developing that talent, and that's a labor of love.
Regional leaders studied Denver’s vote on its FasTracks program as the 10-county metro Atlanta region prepares for its 2012 vote on a 10-year, 1 percent sales tax to fund transportation projects. Here’s a look at what the two proposals have in common and where they differ:
But that law alone doesn't make enforcement any easier for the State Police, which has 90 troopers and civilian inspectors to check nearly 100,000 trucks annually.
In the vicious inventory of violent deaths, Russell “Rusty” Sneiderman’s slaying stands apart. How many men are killed dropping a child off at day care? How many victims have an MBA from Harvard?
The air movement makes the metal fins three times as efficient at removing the heat, he said.
This hybrid salad plays with the flavors of grilled elote, or corn on the cob served as a street food in Mexico. It's coated with a combination of mayonnaise, lime juice, chile powder and cotija cheese, a salty Mexican cheese. In this dish, the dressing picks up on those flavors and the smoky corn goes into a fresh salad with grilled beef.
And a pan-roasted New York steak is a revelation, the beef has so much flavor and unexpected depths. Served with soy-glazed long beans and a tiny pot of spaetzle noodles with some silky bearnaise in which to dip them, it's a fantastic deal for $32. It's not a huge steak, but every bite is tender and delicious.
A jumper by Michael Schmidt extended the Maroons' lead to 22-12 with 6:19 to play in the second quarter. Collinsville got within 25-21 on a 3-pointer by J'Vaughn Williams with 2:57 left in the half, but West pumped the lead to 34-26 at halftime.
According to police, when the neighbor confronted the father about the accusations, he apparently admitted his involvement. The father also told the neighbor he knew what he was doing was wrong.

In a three-page order issued this afternoon, the three-judge panel said doing so could tamper with judicial independence.
There's a gambler or a horse lover in every family, right? If it's racing season (Dec. 26-April 22), take him, her or them to Santa Anita Park (285 W. Huntington Drive, Arcadia), where Seabiscuit once galloped to glory and the view of the San Gabriels is reliably gorgeous. Horses usually run Thursdays-Sundays. For just the cost of breakfast, you can watch early workouts (from 5-10 a.m.) from Clocker's Corner at the west end of the track. In the afternoon, for $5 adult admission, you can watch the races or linger near the paddock and gardens as horses, jockeys and trainers prepare. If it isn't racing season, head north to cozy Sierra Madre, park on East Miramonte Avenue near North Mountain Trail Avenue, and hike the first 1.3 miles of the Mt. Wilson Trail, which will jump-start your heart and give you a big view. Then turn around at First Water, come down and flop on a couch at Bean Town coffeehouse (45 N. Baldwin Ave.) or spoon some homemade ice cream at Mother Moo Creamery (17 Kersting Court). For a homegrown souvenir, make the two-minute drive to E. Waldo Ward & Son (273 E. Highland Ave.), a family business (with fruit trees, red barn and Victorian house) that has made and sold jams and jellies since 1891. Wind up with a snazzy dinner at Wistaria (44 N. Baldwin Ave.).
"She's dangerous, she puts backs under pressure with her speed," Robben said.
National Football League spokesman Brian McCarthy said the league would defer to the team on the roof issue.
The first tiebreaker in the draft for teams with identical records is strength of schedule. Because the Bears played a stronger schedule than the Cardinals, Cowboys, Eagles, Jets, Raiders (their pick now belongs to the Bengals) and Chargers, they pick last among all the 8-8 teams. And picking 19th as opposed to 13th definitely could cost the Bears dearly. If you say the Bears' biggest need is an edge rusher, the Cardinals, Cowboys, Jets and Chargers all could use one as well (though each of those teams runs a 3-4). If you say the Bears really need an offensive tackle, the Cardinals, Jets and Chargers are threats to take one of them. And if you still want another receiver, the Cardinals, Jets and Bengals all could ruin the Bears' plans. As for DeCastro, I think 19 is too high to take a guard who is not elite. If you are going to reach, don't do it for a guard. Do it for a player who can impact your team with big plays. I really don't see guard as a need for this team.
Still other perennials grow in tight clumps, such as coneflowers, daisies, tall phlox and black-eyed Susans (rudbeckia). These require a more brute-force technique. Take a sharp spade or large knife and drive it right into the top of the plant to cut it in half or thirds.
Dumping complaint. Police received a report of a television that had been left near the tennis courts at Tablyn Park, 8735 Stillwater Blvd. Police notified the Lake Elmo Public Works to remove it.
And then there's newcomer Nellcote (833 W. Randolph), where chef Jared Van Camp, along with pastry chef Nate Meads, not only makes all the restaurant's breads in house but is milling the flour for the demi baguette, focaccia and mini brioche paired with house-churned butter that are part of the bread dish. The result? Delicious and so worth the $3 charge.

The state board has been open to considering independent boards for campuses that want them, but it first wanted the Legislature to pass a law giving the entire university system more independence from state control. The law passed and took effect this month.
Floyd said he is certain he missed out on sales, but he would rather lose the revenue than risk losing payments, like Quinlin will.
Blockbuster used to dominate the U.S. movie rental business. But it lost money for years as that business declined because customers shifted to Netflix Inc., video on demand and DVD rental kiosks.
Opponents of freer trade argue that the export gains will be illusory, or will be overwhelmed by a flood of imports. That defies logic, however. The Koreans have higher barriers against American products than we have against theirs, and most Colombian products already enjoy duty-free access to the U.S.
There's even an exhibit that offers instruction on cooking the critters, from batter-fried scallops to conch fritters.

Why didn't you go back for your cellphone? Didn't you always say that colleague was creepy? Did you even try to fight back? Didn't you look around before you got out of the car? Why didn't you scream? You did a background check on the guy before you agreed to date him, right? Right?

Jim McIntyre, a former Multnomah County prosecutor who now works as a criminal defense attorney, said investigators are acting responsibly in keeping close tabs on information. "Their obligation is to objectively investigate the case," he said. "What if it's not her and what if it's someone else?" Focusing solely on one person as a potential suspect could lead investigators to miss the true culprit.
No Siri. The voice assistant feature that Apple introduced with the iPhone 4S won't be included in the new iPad. That's too bad because Siri would have allowed users to access information without having to find the right app.
It is interesting to see director Cary Fukunaga’s use of a moving camera and subtly subdued colors; after the jumpy, energetic look of his completely different modern-immigration drama “Sin Nombre,” it’s a startling change, and evidence of a quickly developing talent.

Saddled by injuries and inconsistency, the Panthers (17-15), lost their way. Barring a miracle run this week at Madison Square Garden, Gibbs’ career will likely come to a close only miles from where he grew up and went to high school at Seton Hall Prep. That’s why the impromptu pep rally on the way to the press conference made him smile.

The task has proven so difficult that last August, the federal Education Department gave states and districts until the start of the 2013-14 school year to have the systems fully implemented for use in teacher compensation and retention decisions. But the process has been rocky: Earlier this year, New York state for a time withheld SIG money from New York City when the city teachers union and the district struggled to reach agreement on an evaluation system.
A resident of Hoboken for the past four years, Rikkola added that she's not the only one with big plans this year.
It will be interesting to see how Baltimore looks against Houston in two weeks, especially if they have Jimmy Smith back, because Matt Schaub can handle pressure and the Texans have a good offensive line. I'd still blitz like hell if I were Pagano. (Especially if Andre Johnson's hamstring isn't 100 percent.) Schaub might burn you a few times, but he'll be woozy by the 4th quarter. When Sanchez threw the interception that Lardarius Webb turned into a 74-yard touchdown, he was trying to throw a short pass in the flat with a three-step drop. The Jets stopped calling patterns with five- and seven-step drops because he was getting hammered. That's the kind of wear and tear the Ravens can put on a quarterback.
"I got lucky," she says. "I'm so inspired by these dancers. When we work together, we really feed each other. We're all such different personalities and have unique ways of moving, but that's inspiring - to watch Michael Montgomery or Meredith Webster or Yujin Kim, and see how they use their bodies is wonderful, but all of us still are directed toward Alonzo's vision."
Kollo said the motive behind the attack was still being determined and that the case is also being investigated by the District Attorney's Office, which is routine in deaths with connections to police activity.

For a desert mountain experience closer to town, I go to Usery Mountain Regional Park and hike the 3.2-mile (round-trip) Wind Cave trail up Pass Mountain, through terrain that resembles a natural botanical garden. At the top of the trail, sensational views look westward toward Mesa. A brand-new visitors center, a choice of shorter or longer trails and organized outings during winter and spring make Usery an ideal place to learn about desert life.

Not that Jell-O salad is necessarily out of the realm of possibilities. One holiday party had a "Remember the '50s'' theme, with the aforementioned salad, seven-layer pseudo Mexican dip, California pot roast (the kind with foil-wrapped meat, canned soup and wine) and more. With it, we watched an early Martha Stewart holiday entertaining tape. The canned green bean casserole made with canned soup and canned French fried onions, nostalgia notwithstanding, found few takers, but otherwise the party was a culinary success.

Fallon offers Teddy, Margaret's son, a baseball signed by Ty Cobb. When the kid, after some hesitation, takes it, Fallon replaces it with a new one from a stash in his desk drawer. Eli, now the hardest of hard-liners on Jimmy's team, sends in 50 guys with billy clubs and has a couple of them take time from busting strikers' skulls to work over Halloran, a move that looks like it will backfire on him. Teddy lets Nucky know about a little secret they share, something that could effect Eli, and puts the baseball away with a picture of Hans Schroeder.

8. THE PHILLIPS AFFAIR: Reds second baseman Brandon Phillips had some mouthy things to say about the Cardinals, calling them crybabies and whiners and such. That sparked the Cardinals to an emphatic sweep of the Cincinnati Reds in Cincinnati. The series was spiked with full-on brawl that featured Johnny Cueto's violent kicks and a concussion for Jason LaRue that ended his career.

But that series forever cast Phillips has a villain, Cueto has a nemesis and the Reds as a bad-blood rival. Remember when Walt Jocketty once used the word "vendetta" to describe the Reds games against the Cardinals? Now it goes both ways.

Within days of that premiere, Marvel announced release dates for "Iron Man 2," "Thor," "Captain America" and, yes, "The Avengers."
Circumstance, too, will shape what gets done. Obama walked into a steep recession, with the financial sector, auto industry and housing market reeling. By necessity he became a manager on the fly, much as George W. Bush did when the terrorist attacks of 2001 changed everything for years to come.
McFarland said he almost hoped the mayor would send police in. "Now I kind of want him to do that," he said.
Several of those to be featured suffered severe bouts of post-traumatic stress disorder, some even attempting suicide. One of the worst afflicted, a Marine who saved the lives of several comrades when he shot to death a would-be suicide bomber, is now in a Texas prison, serving a lengthy sentence for sexual assault.

Boston finally got to McCarthy in the seventh and had an opportunity for a lot more. Jarrod Saltalamacchia singled and Will Middlebrooks stroked a two-bagger down the line in right. Byrd drove home the run with a sacrifice fly to left, and after Mike Aviles popped out, McCarthy walked Ryan Sweeney on a borderline pitch to end his night. New hurler Ryan Cook promptly walked Pedroia and fell behind Adrian Gonzalez before coming back to record a big strikeout.

Small amounts of this sweet and tangy glaze -- which is fat-free, by the way -- go a long way. Keep it stored in a squeeze bottle in the refrigerator, and use it to gussy up cooked meats, poultry, vegetables and even fruit. It's especially tasty drizzled on strawberries.
The findings are preliminary, but researchers are "extremely optimistic" that hatchery operations and water conservation efforts can complement each other, hatchery manager Joe Miller said in a news release. However, scrutiny is required because fish hatchery operations have a "history of unintended consequences" such as producing flawed fish, the news release said.
"We don't have that kind of information that would tell us this stemmed from some hate crime that started somewhere else," Mayor Samuel Jones told Local15, "or even one that started here that was strictly based on race."
Metro-East owned a one-point advantage, 24-23, at the break and led 38-34 after three quarters, but the Shells surged back and tied the score 44-44 on Reine's short jumper with 4:26 to play.

Mathematics and statistics courses have been particularly helpful.
Cathleen Lewis, director of public affairs for AAA New Jersey Automobile Club, said the money from the toll hikes is necessary for road and bridge repairs, but New Jersey needs to create a sustainable solution for its perennially cash-strapped Transportation Trust Fund. The fund, which pays for road and bridge repairs and transit projects, had been raided over the years to help balance the state budget.
NEW YORK -- The Tigers put outfielder Delmon Young on the restricted list today and recalled Danny Worth from Toledo to take Young's spot on the team's 25-man roster, the club announced.
Republicans would win spending cuts of slightly more than the increase in the debt limit, as they have demanded. Additionally, tax increases would be off-limits unless recommended by the bipartisan committee that is expected to include six Republicans and six Democrats. The conservative campaign to force Congress to approve a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution would be jettisoned.
District 7 has three Democratic candidates with strong ties to three different councilmen.
Neither win had seemed assured -- right up until the beginning of this 84th annual ceremony, handicappers were debating whether George Clooney would win best actor, or Viola Davis would take home best actress -- and that uncertainty provided at least a small amount of surprise.
But Angelo endured endless criticism for his lack of draft success despite a Super Bowl and NFC Championship Game appearances.
Soden instructed four players that they were NOT to dress in uniform or sit on the bench with the team for that game because they hadn't been behaving as 'team' members needed to behave. So we went to Half Moon Bay and had only six other players to play that night — Jocelyn had been absent from the last practice due to the flu so, by rule, was not allowed to play, although she did dress down and sit on the bench with the team. By halftime, we were down by 22 points, and the girls came back to the locker room in tears. They wailed about needing their team, to which Soden replied, "THIS is your team! You can win this game or lose it with THIS team — it's up to you."
Orly Taitz, known for her legal challenges of Barack Obama's birth certificate, came in third at 5.5 percent of Republicans. That means Taitz trailed even Feinstein among GOP voters – 6.6 percent of them named the incumbent.

Fukushima, which is about 150 miles from Tokyo and much farther from Kyoto and Hiroshima, are negligible except inside and right near the plant, an area that's been evacuated and is off-limits to all but essential personnel. Issues remain regarding the plant itself.
At the shootaround today, there was some talk about the quote from Lakers center Andrew Bynum in the Los Angeles Times: "Closeout games are actually kind of easy. Teams tend to fold if you come out and play hard in the beginning. So we want to come out and establish a lead and protect it."
I generally avoid cannelloni ($16.50) because I find the pasta mushy and undistinguished, so I ordered it as a test - and it caused me to rethink my prejudices. The pasta still has a gentle bite, plump with herbed ricotta filling, sharing the tube with beef and pork, topped with a cheesy tomato sauce. In addition, there's a house-made ravioli ($16.50) and tagliatelle with pork Bolognese ($16.50).
Less than a third of companies, government agencies and nonprofit organizations said they were planning to expand their workforce by the end of the year.
Sixteen-year-old Kelby Johnson had to leave her school after she came out as a lesbian. It may "get better," as the smart campaign pitched to gay-lesbian- bisexual-transgender youths states, but Kelby and her family's experience in Tuttle, Okla., underscores what bad can feel like.
This struck me as being a bit strange. I, being the shy person I am, wrote a letter to the governor and asked him if he thought this is a bit strange. He did not respond but rather transferred my question to the State Police in Trenton that handles firearms permits. So about two weeks ago I received a phone call from a trooper which will remain anonymous. He explained to me that the reason they require money orders and do not allow checks is in case the check bounced because of insufficient funds and it would place a financial burden on the state to cover the insufficient check charges. I ask him to give me that in writing which he did. I also asked the trooper to pretend he was not in a State Police uniform and look at my question from a citizen’s view point and did he think the requirement was logical. He declined to answer the question. I asked the question several times.
"This therapy can be dangerous," said the bill's author Sen. Ted Lieu. He added the treatments can "cause extreme depression and guilt" that sometimes leads to suicide.
With the time he spends with them, DeChellis simply tries to school the players in the game he loves. It will teach them lessons that may apply later in life, he hopes, but at the academy there's no reason to talk about sports being the way to forge better people. That pretense, and many others, is gone.
Corzine also indicates at the conclusion of his remarks that he will be open to lawmakers’ questions. It is unknown if at some point he will refuse to certain questions and invoke his Constitutional protection against self-incrimination. He also notes that since his departure from MF Global, he has had “limited access to many relevant documents, including internal communications and account statements, and even my own notes, all of which are essential to my being able to testify accurately about the chaotic, sleepless nights preceding the declaration of bankruptcy. Furthermore, even when I was at MF Global, my involvement in the firm’s clearing, settlement and payment mechanisms, and accounting was limited.”
Pan, who was born in China, works as a financial planner, Rochman said. Describing his client as a devout Buddhist, he said: "This is really kind of an American immigrant story, a man who comes to this country as a teenager, doesn't speak the language, educates himself, goes to college, marries, and raises a family."
Neither Obama nor his GOP rivals on Capitol Hill have yet come forward with specific proposals for cutting such benefit programs. Successful efforts to curb the deficit always require active, engaged presidential leadership but Obama's unwillingness to thus far take chances has deficit hawks discouraged. Obama will release his 2012 budget proposal next month.

Clearly, Potdar is a seasoned, creative chef, but the personality he brings to the classic dishes comes through more than in the contemporary ones.
Should he endorse someone in the wide-open GOP field, Christie's backing would come with more than just a photo op. The former fundraiser for George W. Bush is known to be a skilled money man, one who could help any candidate bring in cash for a costly campaign.
But the real fascination lies in Turner's zany juxtapositions of eclectic furniture, collections and art. His Monterey-style furniture, fabricated by Mason Manufacturing for Barker Bros. from 1929 through the mid-'40s, dominates most of the rooms. Because Turner can't abide theme rooms with "everything matching," he adds conversation pieces -- a 1992 Cappellini chaise longue upholstered in albino crocodile, for instance, or a resin deer head that glows in the dark, or a grouping of eye-popping, vintage Blenko glass.
The city is not required to hold a public hearing or post a notice of the decision for the store because the proposal meets type 1 design review standards, said Don Mazziotti, the city's director of community development.
Despite the district's recent gains, enrollment continues to drop by hundreds of students each year as more and more turn to charter schools. State funding also has fallen.
Brodie, viewed as highly influential in city development, also has drawn criticism from residents and business owners who have complained about being pushed out by urban renewal and about the secrecy under which they say his agency has operated.
In the absence of instructions to the contrary, adult children often allow medicine to prolong the dying process. And the default for health care providers is to intervene, both because it's what they're trained to do and as a way of lowering legal liability.
Ohio law allows for such agreements with state's that have "substantially comparable" concealed carry rules. Both Ohio and Louisiana require background checks for long-term residents or an FBI check for short-term residents and both require training in order to be eligible for a concealed carry license, the attorney general's office noted.
A small memorial of flowers, candles and handwritten notes had replaced the yellow police tape outside the salon by Thursday afternoon. One note said: “Dedicated to all who lost and to a most precious Seal Beach that didn’t deserve this carnage.”

King said he expects Wallace will not pick up his option, and will choose instead to be a free agent. The team can offer him a contract extension before that -- at a maximum of two years after the option year, and 7 percent increase over the $9.5 million salary. Wallace has until June 13 to pick up his option. If he does not, he becomes an unrestricted free agent. If he becomes a free agent, the Nets cannot negotiate with him before July 1. However, they would hold Bird Rights on him, and could offer him a maximum contract of five years.

"If Gambling Enforcement has a problem, they need to talk to the Legislature about it or else get out there and do their job," he said. "Just saying, 'Well, we don't have the time or we don't have the manpower,' that just doesn't cut it."
"It made me sick to my stomach that this treatment could be cost-prohibitive to patients whom it could help," Starkey said.
Copts, who make up about 10% of Egypt's population of around 82 million, have long complained of discrimination and oppression in a country where Sunni Muslims make up the absolute majority. Since his first day as pope in 1971, Shenouda had no fear of publicly pressuring politicians for Copts' rights. In 1981, he blamed then-President Anwar Sadat for not protecting Christians from violence carried out by radical Islamists.

Wolseley Plc, the British company that owns Ferguson, has been hard hit by the decline in construction. The company said in September that it has eliminated more than 10,000 jobs.
The most recent cuts in the federal budget eliminated the only federal grant for gifted education. Missouri eliminated its set-aside state funding for gifted education in 2006, and fewer of the state's students have been served by gifted education since. Of the state's 522 school districts, fewer than 60 percent report any gifted programming.
Hartman said it was a tough call to make.
On the other side, the Giants do depend on a vertical passing game, which should be more difficult as the rain continues. Either way, the rain can have an effect on both offenses and the defenses, which were both torched in the last meeting, wouldn't mind a weather advantage.

On the verge of a major tour and armed with an excellent new album, Beach House finds itself in a familiar position: A band on the doorstep of indie-fame. As the lines of indie and major blur more each day, that's a tempting spot for any band hoping to make a living off its art. Beach House is no different, except its members want the music — not the hype — to lead them to longevity.

--Walking adds years to your life. Yes, that's a plural: years. To get more life out of your walks, just pick up the pace. You don't have to walk any longer. Simply add several short, 30-second bursts of faster-than-usual walking to your routine. In between these mini-power walks, return to your usual pace. This alone could add an extra four to five years to your life.

The move gives opponents a long-shot chance to reverse their legal losses before taking their appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. But it also increases the likelihood that the case will stretch into 2013, well past the presidential election.
Martinez moved his family to the Sacramento area two years ago from Napa, where he worked at the Michelin-starred Bistro Jeanty. He's had other job opportunities, but lost some after potential employers checked his background. Either way, Martinez says, Hawks and Sacramento are happy homes for him.
Like the rest of the tanning industry, the 1990s and the early part of 2000s were a period of explosive growth for Beckman. But he began to hit speed bumps several years ago amid the mounting health warnings about the links between using tanning beds with ultraviolet light and skin cancer.

The option of deducting sales taxes is especially popular in Florida, Texas, Nevada, Washington and other states that don't have their own income tax. But you don't have to live in those states to be eligible for this option. Many people who live in other states and who itemize their deductions may find it advantageous to deduct their sales taxes instead of state and local income taxes.

The fact that children can do toxic things to relationships is not a news flash. Diapers! Feedings! Strollers! No sleep! No sex! The endless loop has played out extensively in movies, and if that's all Jennifer Westfeldt was interested in exploring, "Friends With Kids" would be a tedious enterprise.

Oil and gas prices are rising again. That translates into more than just digging deeper into the wallet at the gas pump. Energy costs, through their manufacturing and transportation impacts, push up prices in the supermarket and other retail stores.
The first-place Dodgers avoided their first three-game losing streak of the season. It's just the second time since 1988 that Los Angeles has won at least 18 of its first 27 games.
Teplitz argued the board was going against two prior resolutions — passed in 2010 — that stipulated the DRPA would no longer finance economic development projects apart from the operation of four Delaware River bridges and the PATCO High Speed Line. The DRPA spent $300 million in the name of economic development between 2002 and 2009 — equal $150 million allocations for both New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

Both Mallett and Hoyer are valuable trading chips. The Pats may still keep both, but if some team finds themselves without a starter, the Pats certainly have ammunition. Mallett says he’s fine waiting and learning for now behind Brady. He’s hopeful his day will eventually come.
I can't answer that, except sometimes it takes all of us a while to find our way - or just to figure out how to get things done.
Game of Shadows is a buddy movie, too, in which the women are pushed to one side (or literally pushed from a train) so Holmes and Watson, casting admiring gazes at one another, can trade badinage and banter. The fact that Downey's Holmes finds an excuse to doll up in a woman's frock, curls and rouge only adds to the, um, buddyness of the proceedings. (Not that there's anything wrong with that, as they used to say on Seinfeld.) And so there's no place for the just-betrothed Mary Watson (Kelly Reilly), nor for the first movie's femme fatale Irene Adler (the impossibly un-fatale Rachel McAdams), who makes an early exit here. Noomi Rapace, the original Lisbeth Salander in the Swedish adaptations of Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, has some serious action cred of her own, though, so she's allowed to tag along with the boys. She's Madam Simza, a soothsaying Gypsy whose brother is somehow involved with Moriarty.
Semenko, on the other hand, used his real name, authorities said. He told friends of growing up in Russia and teaching English at the Harbin Institute of Technology in China. Semenko — who is fluent in Russian, Mandarin, English and Spanish — came to Seton Hall in 2005 to earn dual masters’ degrees in Asian studies/diplomacy and international relations.

When I first read that media mogul Rupert Murdoch had closed down his sensationalist British tabloid News of the World, my first reaction was, "Good riddance!" But I'm no longer rejoicing -- the scandal around the now defunct daily's unscrupulous journalism will encourage government controls of the media world-wide.
øFor the exhibit, for example, the "cyclops" skull on display takes its cue from the suggestion that the skull of a prehistoric elephant called a mastodon, tipped on its side, might have resembled the skull of a one-eyed giant to the ancients, including a Roman emperor who perhaps kept a mastodon skull on display. A horn-faced dinosaur called Protoceratops, may have partly inspired the griffin.
In past years, country singers have done extremely well, being pushed along by votes throughout middle America. Last year's Scotty McCreery and Season 4's now-superstar Carrie Underwood come to mind. After a forgettable performance, I don't see Likens joining the Southern ranks any time soon. The twang is there but the power just isn't. J-Lo says she is excited to see where Likens goes in the future. I fear it might be back to West Virginia sooner than later.

Burial was at Lake View Cemetery.
Ayers and his wife, Bernardine Dohrn, went underground in 1970, finally surrendering to the FBI in 1980; all charges against him were dropped, owing to government misconduct. He was almost 40 years removed from those "Days of Rage" when his brush with Barack Obama -- on an anti-poverty foundation board in the '90s -- sparked presidential primary questions from George Stephanopoulos and conservative talk radio.
He said his goal isn't a full-time move from sports to news, as Holliday did in 1989 and former Channel 5 sports director Mike Bush did eight years ago - and he remains the station's lead male anchor. It's a trend not limited to Channel 5. KMOV (Channel 4) sports director Steve Savard fills in occasionally as a news anchor on that station. KTVI (Channel 2) newscaster Randi Naughton used to work in sports.

"It was a happy relationship," he says. "We spent a long time on the story. If you read the book, it is radically different. When we bought the book, we didn't buy it for the story as such.

For investors who do buy into Carlyle, however, there is the promise of a special "true-up" dividend at the end of each year based on higher distributable earnings during good years. While the company has set a quarterly dividend of 16 cents that would result in an annual dividend yield of between 2.6% and 2.8%, a "true-up" dividend for 2011 would have resulted in a total annual dividend yield to shareholders between 7.6% and 9.3%, based on the IPO price range.

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety questions whether the federal efforts are premature or at least misdirected.

All of the coaches interviewed for this story said that most of the players that wind up in their programs are, for the most part, fundamentally strong.

If I were going to recommend only one of these programs, of the more than several I've seen — and it may not be a bad idea to watch only one — it is History Channel's "9/11: The Days After" (Friday). A sequel to the 2008 "102 Minutes That Changed America" (which will be rebroadcast on Biography, A&E, History and Lifetime on Sept. 11), it begins in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the Twin Towers. Assembled mostly from home video and B-roll news footage, it proceeds without narration or talking heads. What would usually be considered mistakes — false starts, wild shots, random chatter — are left in for immediacy. It is a construction, unavoidably, but one that does not tell you what to think or how to feel — there is a quiet score, which helps knit the pieces without unduly coloring it — and puts you, as much as possible, into the place and time. As such it is hard to watch, and impossible to turn off.

Head is yet another Class AAA cautionary tale. While he was tearing it up at Columbus this season and the Indians were not hitting, a number of fans wondered why Head had not been promoted.

Much as in the other anticipated showdown between Democratic incumbents Dennis Kucinich and Marcy Kaptur in a possible lakefront district that stretches from Cleveland to Toledo, the ideological and policy differences between Fudge and Turner look to be slight.

Not everything went the Rams' way Saturday. The team needs two starting defensive tackles after releasing 2011 starters Fred Robbins and Justin Bannan on Monday.

Ohio Republican Party Chairman Kevin DeWine issued a statement blaming Obama for what he called a "Democrat downgrade."
Unfortunately, the national campaigns have veered toward the nasty and the silly this year. Romney survived the primary season thanks in part to super PACs and campaign spending that crushed his long line of rivals with negative commercials. Both parties seem to believe this election will be won by the one who does the best job of destroying the other. With that in mind, it's worth remembering that whether you like him or not, Daniels ran two successful campaigns for governor that were heavy on positive messages and policy ideas. He said political victories that follow "slash-and-burn" campaigns seldom lead to great accomplishments.
Other observers have noted that it's difficult to truly compare individual charter's ISAT passing rates to the CPS district average passing rate given that schools often serve wildly different neighborhoods.

"We are happy to be stuck with you Gov Christie. Will continue to work with you to make New Jersey more affordable & business friendly’’ — tweet from Assemblywoman Caroline Casagrande (R-Monmouth)
It's an appropriate name. Sukhothai means "Dawn of Happiness" and was the first independent Thai kingdom, founded in the 13th century. Sukhothai Restaurant in Tampa didn't open until a little later, but it still represented the first giddily exotic Asian food for a lot of us. Sure, we'd had chow mein and egg rolls, but aromatic curries, tom ka gai lush with coconut milk and pad Thai with its rice noodles and crushed peanuts seemed all new. The restaurant's location was no accident — world travelers from nearby MacDill Air Force Base represented the first stalwart customers.

There was that 4-foot putt on the 17th hole in regulation that he hit firm to eliminate the break, knowing that if he had missed the ball likely would have rolled off the green. On some of the toughest greens in golf, Nicklaus only had one three-putt all week. The olive pants — his wife called them his "Army pants" — that he liked so much he wore them again in the playoff. And the 18th hole in the playoff, when Palmer picked up Nicklaus' ball, only for USGA executive director Joe Dey to run onto the green and remind them it was stroke play and Nicklaus had to finish the hole.

The chicken goes into the pot with cold water to cover - but to cover by how much? In her acclaimed "Zuni Cafe Cookbook" (W. W. Norton, 2002) Rodgers suggests 4 quarts water to one 51/2-pound chicken and tells readers not to worry if the bird isn't submerged. (It won't be.) Cut off the wings or legs so the carcass sits lower in the pot, she suggests, but don't add more water.

14. Charl Schwartzel, South Africa -- Having played and traveled almost non-stop on the European Tour and the PGA Tour since the beginning of the year, Schwartzel is taking a month-long break at home with his family in South Africa. In his second season as a full-time member of the U.S. Tour, he will return in two weeks for the Players Championship, in which he tied for 26th last year coming off his victory in the Masters. … Even though he has yet to win in 2012, Charl has played solid golf in his 10 events this season, posting four finishes in the top 10 and six in the top 20. His worst results came leading up to and including his defense of his title at Augusta National, where he tied for 50th after missing the cut in the Transitions Championship and the Shell Houston Open. Now that his year as reigning Masters champion, and being a first-time major winner, is over, perhaps he can relax and get back to playing his best golf. … Schwartzel began the next phase of career by finishing solo sixth at the Maybank Malaysian Open the week after the Masters and is looking forward to the rest of the season, especially the majors. Last year after winning at Augusta, showed that victory was no fluke when he tied for ninth in the U.S. Open at Congressional, tied for 16th in the Open Championship at Royal St. George's and tied for 12th in the PGA Championship at Atlanta Athletic Club.

After pop powerhouse Whitney Houston's death last month, an "Idol" tribute night in honor of the Newark native was always on the horizon. When Houston was alive, "Idol" performers spent nearly a decade trying to match the diva's vocal prowess, choosing to sing her biggest hits and usually falling short. Often they would be fed the ever-popular "the song was too big for you" line by the judges. And the judges were right.

"It is wrong that our own federal government is suing the people of Arizona for helping to enforce federal immigration law. As a direct result of failed and inconsistent federal enforcement, Arizona is under attack from violent Mexican drug and immigrant smuggling cartels," Brewer said in a written statement.

We still don't know exactly what happened after George Zimmerman got out of his vehicle, but since he had a gun (which he was not supposed to be carrying as a crime watch member) he would feel safer about confronting Martin.

Only the bare engine block, built by Mercedes-Benz AMG, is shared with any other car. "We want to be like Ettore Bugatti," Mr. Pagani said, "where every piece of the car is a work of art.

I fear to conjure You with prayer,
The only silver lining that I see to this debate, if you can call it that, is that perhaps our politicians will finally realize that they must finally make the tough decisions that we elect them to do as our representatives — not decisions that will necessarily enhance their political popularity with the members of their party, but that will save this country for the long-term to the benefit all Americans. I'm not holding my breath.

The beauty of Web 2.0, Stein said, is more than the success stories. Just as important, the new economics have "lowered the cost of failing," he said. "Five years ago it would have taken $10 or $15 million to determine if you had a business. Most start-ups are ultimately unsuccessful. By lowering the cost of failure, now a team can tell for $2 or $3 million whether or not it's pointed in the right direction."

It’s unclear how much financial responsibility the Garden State would bear for the project. New Jersey forfeited at least $3 billion in federal funds when the governor canceled ARC due to projected cost overruns.
Funny, he said, how many of them were 1 irons. There was the shot at Pebble Beach that helped him hold off Bruce Crampton. There was also another 1 iron at Augusta National, with Tom Weiskopf and Johnny Miller pressuring him, that led to his Masters victory in 1975.
On top of everything else, the districts in the winning entries are, on balance, more compact and more respectful of county lines than the current maps. Fewer districts cross county lines. So it's not as if you have to draw weird districts to achieve fairness and competitiveness.

King called on America to do nothing more nor less than to live up to its founding ideals, and the revolution nurtured by his words awoke the conscience of a nation. For King, overcoming segregation and discrimination was a matter not only of protesting a social evil but of transforming oneself in the process.

A position-by-position preview of what to expect when the Oregon State Beavers
The government buildings at State Center have aged beyond their useful life. They do not suit the state's needs well; they are expensive to maintain; and, in some cases, they may actually be dangerous to the civil servants who work there. Faced with that reality, the state could have knocked the buildings down and built new ones in their place, at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars, or more. It could have abandoned the complex and rented office space for workers downtown — the preferred solution of the litigants in this case. But that would have left a giant ghost town in central Baltimore and would have forced state agencies to split themselves among commercial buildings.
In February, 13 public education buildings and 11 emergency service facilities in Oregon were chosen to receive grants worth $15 million dollars from the Seismic Rehabilitation Grant Program (SRGP). The program seeks to physically strengthen schools and emergency service buildings.

The new plan with most major schools offering multi-year scholarships is another step toward protecting players from these situations. I have questioned Meyer about his roster management at Ohio State and will continue to keep tabs on the players who leave and the circumstances under which they depart, but Meyer's reputation in this area is not one of a coach who constantly oversigns at the expense of current players who are following the rules but not producing. Some other SEC coaches have a problem with that.

"We battled back in the third," said LW Brayden Schenn, who scored a goal Thursday. "We had a couple chances in overtime on the power play, and we weren't able to capitalize. That's pretty hard. We didn't come out with the start we wanted to, but we battled back and I think we gotta start winning some more battles and compete a little harder.

Other e-mails show Fakhouri ordered county department heads to support Ficano's annual fund-raising gala by selling $500 tickets.

This is the big question, and most people think taking the lump sum is the smart move. That’s not always the case. First, spreading the payments out protects you from becoming the latest lottery winner who’s lost all their money. Don McNay, author of the book “Son of a Son of a Gambler: Winners, Losers and What to Do When You Win the Lottery,” says nine out of 10 winners go through their money in five years or less. “It’s too much, too fast,” he says. “Nobody is around them putting the brakes on the situation.”

“Let me tell why this is important to me,” said Tavenner, who actually started his coaching career at Spalding. “I was the head coach at Bowling Brook from 1994-2000. We won the B division in 1995, 1996, 1999 and 2000. We did that with court-involved kids with no wrestling experience. They worked very hard to achieve that goal. I was so proud of those guys and the guys from the other teams I coached at the Brook. But that first championship was a special one for me.

The framework plan was developed under the assumption a Portland streetcar line extension rolls into the city and stops in the Foothills district. One of six essential conditions in the project is that streetcar planning moves forward, which includes financing and alignment details being finalized.

Concerns about the ability of the Spanish and Italian governments to control their debt come after a Friday debt downgrade for Greece that gave investors more reason to fear that country would need more help managing its debts following a $157 billion loan package it received last year.
If you get to that point, go out and buy two of Dr. Steven Wieder’s TUNG Brush and Gel at Bed Bath & Beyond. I use mine twice, sometimes three times a day! Keep them at your house, so it’s not so obvious, and say, ‘I’ve heard these are amazing. Want to try?’ If she questions whether she has bad breath, just say ‘Yeah, but sometimes me too, so lets see if it helps!’
Some of the basics of that system:
"Sea Lions Tonite" is again a must-see Summer Nights offering, primarily because of its willingness to mock SeaWorld and its workers. New parody fodder is "One Ocean," the whale show that debuted in Orlando in April.
Through the years, the story became a morality tale warning about strange men. But by the 1800s, the story had Grandma and Red Riding Hood outwitting the fox and being saved by a hunter.

Perhaps its biggest problem is that it has two separate and largely incompatible parts. It feels like Microsoft took a nice dress and attached it to an equally fine pantsuit and tried to pass it off as one garment. It just doesn't work.
Sprint's senior tax lawyer at one point wrote that the company is already taking some risk with unbundling. Our risks are exponentially increased if we try to pursue refunds when we didn't jump through the hoops on unbundling  a reference to the precise bookkeeping method on which Sprint based its choice not to collect the sales taxes.

It makes me wonder whether this new law will prove to be yet another regulatory hurdle that will get in the way of small-business owners who we need to lead the economic revival. And because it's the workers who have to pay to get the new "food handler cards," it seems like the little guy is getting hosed, again.
Now a volunteer pitching coach at USC, House, 65, has also worked with Saints quarterback Drew Brees. In fact, Brees recommended House to Smith.
Applying caulk is a fairly easy skill to master. There are many ways to do it, but I will share an effective method I have used for years. First, get a caulk that is easy to use and cleans up with water. I prefer to use caulk that is blend of acrylic and silicone. You can find this common caulk at a paint store, hardware store or a home center. A more expensive caulk will likely have better ingredients and, therefore, last longer. Read the labels on different tubes of caulk, and try to find one that says it has the least amount of shrinkage.
"Andy's going in the right direction," said general manager Brian Cashman. "But he's going to need more time. He's got a few more starts to go. Mechanically, he's good. He got his work in, but he's not there yet. Nothing changes for Andy, regardless of what's taken place at the major league level. Andy's got to go through the right motions. At his age, having been away a year, he'll be ready when he's ready. There's no added urgency."
"Dirk came up to me and said, 'Happy to see you here,'" Aldridge said. "I think he had spoken out about that I should be here. That was big for me (for Nowitzki) to come up to me and say that."

2. A Christmas Story (1983): Don't need to say too much about this, but what is Christmas without the adorable Ralphie, the foul-mouthed Mr. Parker and the coveted Red Ryder BB gun? The flat-tire scene and the dinner at the Chinese restaurant still crack me up.

McMahon's lawyers say creating the joint venture that now delivers milk to Chicago schoolkids "was suggested, proposed and encouraged by CPS . . . . CPS explained that they thought they could get better pricing and service if they made one award to one vendor for the entire city."
With the publication for the first time this month of Stegner's letters, edited by his son Page and published by Shoemaker & Hoard, his considerable ability to inspire, exhort and engage those around him -- on issues central to the West as well as many others -- is being given a new stage. Perhaps most striking to read today are his many letters that take up now-trendy environmental issues, including an eloquent and much-quoted 1960 missive that asserts, "Something will have gone out of us as a people if we ever let the remaining wilderness be destroyed; if we permit the last virgin forests to be turned into comic books and plastic cigarette cases."

"La Luna" is delightful, even as it forgos the crazy sight-gags that typically define Pixar work, but the real standout in this strong lineup of nominees is "The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore." The work of children's book artist/author William Joyce and animator Brandon Oldenburg, this 15-minute gem borrows from The Wizard of Oz, from Buster Keaton (its title character is Keatonesque, to say the least), and from old nursery rhymes (Humpty Dumpty is featured prominently). But along with its gentle surrealist tone, there's a note of melancholy, and of danger. Made in Louisiana, "Morris Lessmore" summons up memories of the Katrina disaster, too.
Shattenkirk said he'll be happy to be playing a lot of minutes because it will give him less time on the bench to think about things he may have done wrong and that he will be using the veterans for guidance. He said he could feel a change Monday as the Blues went through a 45-minute session. "There's definitely a seriousness to the meetings," he said. "Everyone's coming to the rink with more of a focus, everyone is ready to go as soon as they step on the ice."

The cast, which includes Richard Chamberlain as Eileen's priest and Michael McGrady as her husband, is likable, and there are some touching and funny moments.

A .291 career hitter, Schumaker plays down his natural ability to hit, but there is something behind his discomfort at the plate. The bat model he uses doesn't feel right in his hand and hasn't for years. Before the 2004 season, Schumaker received the wrong model of bats. He ordered I13 models and received R161s, the major difference being the thicker handle on the R161 bat. Stuck with the wrong bat, Schumaker hit .316 that next summer, led the Class AA league in hits and hasn't gone back to the preferred model since.

Tea has about half as much caffeine as coffee. Decaffeinated coffee has some caffeine, but the 2 to 4 mg in an 8-ounce cup is a smidgen compared with the caffeinated version.

The second scene is several years later. My daughter is now a fiercely independent reader, and has sped through the next five Harry Potter books by herself, reading and rereading them faster than I ever could. We decide to splurge on the seventh and final book in the series and each buy a copy, standing in line at a local bookstore to scoop them up at midnight. We rush home to start reading, but the next morning a funny thing happens. My feisty, lovely, half-grown daughter admits to me that the first few chapters have been absolutely heartbreaking, and she doesn't know if she wants to read it alone. Sheepishly she asks, "Would you read it to me?"
If players are entitled, or coaches let the best players have a longer leash ... that isn't a unique problem.
The biggest of these is the case involving health care in the state prisons. About 10 years ago, legal advocates and inmates began suing the state in federal court, claiming that the care in the prisons was so bad that it represented cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the U.S. Constitution. A judge agreed and eventually appointed an independent overseer to improve conditions, essentially giving him a blank check to spend taxpayer dollars to fix the problem.
The barge had one purpose: To hide the giant claw that the Glomar Explorer would use to grab the Russian sub. When the mission took place, the barge was towed out to sea and submerged. Its retractable roof was opened, and the Glomar Explorer maneuvered above it to lift the claw into its belly.

An overgrown pine tree at the corner of Kildeer Avenue and East 193rd Street covers street-name markers posted on a utility pole. The solution?

Both of my children have been victims of bullying, both physical and verbal, including cyberbullying, from children they did not know, as well as from supposed "friends" and, yes, even at the hands of those adults who have pledged to protect them.

Still, even the year-over-year data (which make seasonal variations irrelevant) look impressive. The economy added 1.6 million jobs from December 2010 to December 2011, according to the latest estimates. Some economists, however, believe this is also exaggerated. The job-count numbers are based on payroll samples via unemployment insurance reports. But those, too, are subject to error. We'll get a much better picture of 2011 next month, when the Labor Department trues up its job-growth with more complete payroll counts.

Rupp, who had been battling a cold all week, said he didn't want the race to come down a late kick, and figured his only chance to win was to make the early move.
Studies show that first and second generation immigrants favor making English the official language of the United States — and that they do so, in fact, at a higher rate than the general American population. If opposition to illegal immigration were what the Official English movement is about, surely this would not be the case. People come to America with the expectation that we speak English here and that they need to learn English in order to be successful.
Manzanita Street, 9:45 p.m.: Gunshots were heard.

But not "Lost" fans. They turn left and take the two-lane road past often rocky beaches. There's a youth camp, some houses and farms, before the road essentially dead-ends at Kaena Point. Tourist facilities? Unless you want to go glider soaring at Dillingham Field, get lost.

said European sales of commercial air conditioners rose 8% from a year earlier, which executives attributed to a drive for energy efficiency. But European orders for refrigerated trailers, also housed within the company's Carrier unit, fell more than 10%.
Indeed, the "uninsured crisis" itself is properly regarded as a symptom, not a cause, of high costs. The insured consume two and a half times as much health care as the uninsured. This massive consumption is largely a result of being insured, and therefore immunized from the direct cost of health care. It's as if you paid a $10 co-pay for a tank of gas and your car insurer paid the balance. The roads would be even more congested than they are now! Further, one third to one half of this spending does not contribute to better health. The blunt fact is that most of us are overinsuredbut few of us are prepared to accept that fact, so most politicians ignore it.
"We are in a very tough time," he said. "Can we survive with just the Battle of the Dance? It will be tough, but we will try."
When I was here for my firstNew Year's Eve, several thousand people were crammed into Lake Sumter Landing listening to the dance band. I realized that most of the people there would have been sitting at home asleep in their chairs before the ball dropped if they hadn't moved to The Villages.

Brockovich: I think that there's complacency and apathy throughout our country, and we think the EPA is going to come and save our butts on these types of problems, and they're very absent for a whole host of reasons. We have been completely failed. Then a film comes out or there's some convergence and people realize: "Oh (expletive), this is in my backyard." The issue is more relevant and more daunting today than when I began my work in 1991.

Sahele, like most Eritreans here, was part of the country's Kunama community. Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993, but the two countries continued to battle over the farm-rich Kunama land.

"We need to be able to keep the level of tourism Positively Cleveland has built over the years," she said.

"I've been close once in Seattle and had it broken up in the eighth," said Weaver, who struck out nine and retired 22 of his last 23 batters after Iannetta's miscue. "We were having this conversation about five days ago, and C.J. (Wilson) came up to me and said: 'Why don't you just go out there and throw a no-hitter?' And I said: 'There's no way. There's no chance.' So it's funny that it happened."
Kinghorn and the districts agree that the economy is the driving force behind the slowdown. People aren't moving as much. They might be reluctant to buy new homes if they have recently lost a job or fear that they lack job security.

Most people do not fully understand trillion-dollar deficits, the national debt, or what the debt ceiling is, so let's be clear on what we are talking about. There are structural imbalances in government operations that have resulted in the U.S. government spending far more than it takes in from tax revenues. Contrary to what some partisans claim, these deficits did not suddenly appear during the Obama administration; they have been a part of U.S. government finances since World War II. Over the last several decades, to cover the cash shortfalls, the government has borrowed a total of $14.3 trillion through the sale of U.S. Treasury bonds. Individuals and institutions buy the bonds and then earn interest on what they believe are safe investments backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. The government uses the cash to pay its bills.

The Wings have been a beat-up and oft-beaten team lately, and this 7-2 victory over Columbus was welcome in every way. I won't make a big deal of them building a 4-0 lead on the Blue Jackets before half of the fans found their seats. At that point, the Blue Jackets called time-out, presumably because it beat the alternative, which was to keep playing.
AA lot of folks do want to stay in their home. We need to be able to provide services and companionship and medical and transportation. That will be a bigger part of our business. And there will a nice market for people who don't want to deal with the issues at home. They prefer a "cruise ship" on land. We have to be careful about what and where we build. We're building buildings with 30- or 40-year mortgages.

But we should: "… a growing body of scientific evidence has indicated that the air within homes and other buildings can be more seriously polluted than the outdoor air in even the largest and most industrialized cities. Thus, for many people, the risks to health may be greater due to exposure to air pollution indoors than outdoors," advises the EPA.
Tressel's superiors, Athletic Director Gene Smith and university President E. Gordon Gee, have come off as either clueless (Smith) or witless (Gee). In the December news conference, Smith breezily said there was no "systemic" problem at Ohio State, an assertion that now seems to have been wishful thinking. During the epic embarrassment of the March news conference about the cover-up, Gee joked that he worried Tressel would fire him, not the other way around.

After some consultation, Susan and I settled on a place for a romantic weekend: the Hotel Drisco on Pacific Avenue in residential Pacific Heights. The hotel is set among the mansions and gardens of San Francisco's wealthiest neighborhood and looks more like one of the city's trademark low-rise, stuccoed apartment buildings than a hotel. The Drisco has housed guests for more than 100 years. Its 40-odd rooms and suites still exude turn-of-the-last-century charm, but recent renovations and indulgent service ensure contemporary comforts and amenities. And, of course, there was plenty of fog to envelop us.

It was considered an unusually tough measure for a state long represented by the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, the architect of the modern-day immigration system.

"We came all this way to the moon, and yet the most significant thing we're seeing is our own home planet ..." Forty years after the first moonwalk, NASA has chosen to lead its anniversary coverage with Apollo 8 astronaut Bill Anders' comment about the Earth. That fact alone shows how much the focus has changed since the first Space Age, when it seemed that everyone on Earth was looking outward into space. Ironically, what made the astronauts different was that they alone could look back home.

“There was a point in the first half, and I was thinking 'You better not cry,''' Roy said. “I mean, serious. I mean, there was a moment where I felt really sorry for myself.

Warren's return — he signed a two-year contract last summer — is one reason the Broncos haven't done anything at defensive tackle in free agency this year.

Although it is tempting to stay on the property taking advantage of the free yoga, the Pilates Reformer classes and the huge pools, try taking a hotel bike (or borrow one of the hotel's Mercedes convertibles) and explore nearby wineries such as Sterling or Chateau Montelena. The architecture is worth seeing too, some of it über-modern, some like medieval castles.
By 5:21 p.m. March 15, she sent a note announcing that she had relaxed and was back in Hoboken with the hope that Corzine would see her and that the quiet time could give way to being "temporarily noisy." Ninety-three minutes later, she wrote: "Anybody there???... 9 p.m. drinks? 9:30? 10?" Six minutes after that, she wrote: "Tomorrow? Sat? Sunday? 2008? 2009? 2020?"
Cooley Law School professor Alan Gershel, a former top federal prosecutor, said it appears there would be a potential case  maybe even a bank fraud violation in the transactions.

The Heat has beaten the Cavs twice this season in Miami. This is the third and final meeting of the season. LeBron James is having another MVP-caliber season, averaging 28 points, 8.2 rebounds and 6.8 assists. The Heat became the first team in 41 years to sweep a back-to-back-to-back set, all on the road. The 1970-71 Milwaukee Bucks were the last team to accomplish the feat.
Ms. Mosser said pushing more derivatives onto exchanges, as the law demands, would make the market more transparent and safer, people familiar with the matter said.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein nicely summed up the GOP’s strange behavior to The New York Times: “This is part of a larger effort, candidly, to cut back on rights and services to women. We’ve seen it go from discussions on Roe v. Wade, to partial birth abortion, to contraception, to preventive services for women. This seems to be one more thing.”

"All too often, jazz is taught with a pre-historic date stamped on it, like 'Way back in 1912 or 1947, this happened in jazz,'" says the Solon native, via phone from his home in New York. "If you want kids to embrace it, you have to put right there in front of them."
I'm not dismissing the concerns raised by the new security rules. With the Christmas season coming, there could be more disruption. But frankly when I fired up my computer Sunday afternoon, I could find little on the serious issues raised by the TSA policy over the weekend.
Transplanting Kirn's book to the present-day economy means Bingham is a supremely busy man - so much in demand that his quest to rack up 10 million frequent-flier miles is finally within reach. But what is the toll of hopping from city to city, living in hotel rooms and airport terminals with no one and nothing to return to back home?
"Well see. Whatever play (offensive coordinator) Frank Cignetti thinks we should run first, that will be a factor in who gets it."
Rang believes Hardin will get that opportunity, in part because it's a lean year for NFL safety prospects. Rang says Hardin is an underrated prospect who some NFL scouts believe can make the transition from cornerback to safety.
For his call of the Devils-Panthers series on MSG+. This was a masterful display of yakking by Cangialosi. His timing, his ability to enhance the drama (especially in Game 7), was hockey play-by-play at its best. Chico Resch, his partner, had a fine series, too. The p-b-p man set him up well. These voices showed balance. Unlike other local hockey broadcasters, they did not whine about penalties or spend much time questioning calls. They didn't waste words on jive. Instead, they focussed on the game. Cangialosi has huge shoes to fill replacing Doc Emrick. He's providing evidence his feet are pretty big.
"I think in some ways we're seeing now what we always see with marketing, which is that a good idea is originally seen as innovative, but now that everyone is going it is becoming sort of commoditized," Swangard said.

This view is already readily available 24/7 on Fox News to anyone with a TV and strong stomach; so why does the U-T waste valuable editorial space to give Hedgecock a forum he so richly does not deserve? Like so many right-wingers, Hedgecock is just another attack dog. Little insight flows from his poison pen. He has his own syndicated radio show where like-minded Obama-haters can assemble to spew their collective invective, which I happily ignore. So why must I endure him on the editorial page of my local paper as well?
Birding trail routes on Internet The Colorado Birding Trail has expanded to the west.

Only a handful of similar projects exist in New Jersey. Jennifer Senick, director of the Rutgers Center for Green Building, said the green economy is "steaming forward" despite the recession, so any town looking to capitalize "is doing a smart thing."
If this is true, there's no reason those mechanisms should take four years or cost tens of thousands of dollars. Instead of teaching students particular facts—the sort of information that can now be looked up on a phone—students would learn how to think about thinking.
August 18, 1971. Following the St. Louis Symphony performance of "Scythian Suite" at Powell Hall, the story goes, Music Director Walter Susskind turns to Assistant Leonard Slatkin and says, "I'm glad they just restored this place. We would have needed to build buttresses otherwise."

* Defensive lineman John Simon continues to show a new level of quickness firing off the ball. Watch the video and you'll see just one example of how he routinely beats the first-team tackles in head-to-head drills. Jack Mewhort and Reid Fragel will get better each time they face Simon.
HOBOKEN A state Superior Court judge will hear oral arguments today in Jersey City from three Hoboken developers seeking to overturn a city ordinance that requires developers of new housing to set aside units for lower-income residents.
In retrospect, LucasArts should have dropped any pretense of being a real game and just presented this as a kid-friendly collection of mini-games. As it is, the T-for-teen rating seems conservative. Tone down the lightsaber burn marks a tad and give that Rancor some Zoloft, and this could have been an E-10+ experience for the whole family.
Selig said he's pleased the sale is finished and the Dodgers can have a fresh start after the “unbecoming events of recent years.”
Yoakum is the first of eight defendants in the case to be sentenced; the rest followed his lead, pleading guilty to various drug conspiracy charges. Judge Jones said he was glad Yoakum stepped up and pleaded guilty, but chided him for his lack of responsibility in fathering 24 children with multiple women, without any means of support. "That's the height of irresponsibility," Jones said, verifying in court Monday that Yoakum has fathered 24 children, ranging in age from 5-month-old twins to 38.

Cedar's timing and cinematographer Yaron Scharf's gift for details are nearly impeccable. It's a film rife with close-ups. Of faces, to be sure. One could set base camp at actor Micah Lewesohn's stony forehead. He plays Eliezer's bitter rival Yehuda Grossman.
The popularity of the Spanish fishing village first surged in the 1970s, with windsurfing. A second gust of popularity arrived with the advent of kiteboarding in the 1990s. Kitesurfing is easier to learn, and the lightweight gear packs up like a picnic.

He was booked into the Pinal County Adult Detention Center.
The Multnomah County district attorney's office dismissed a disorderly conduct allegation against assistant coach Kacy Fairfax in the same case. The district suspended the three with pay -- as well as a fourth football coach who was at the scene, but not charged -- while the district reviews their actions. A decision could come as early as next week.
Edwin was just named the Asian Film Awards' Edward Yang New Talent winner, in part because, as festival executive director Roger Garcia puts it, Edwin is "a game changer."

Water bills: City officials say they want to cut down on the number of water bills that are estimated rather than based on actual water meter readings.

But most members of Louisville's new City Council represent formerly suburban districts, and critics of the new system say it has shifted resources and development to the fringes at the expense of working-class neighborhood in the region's core.

As University of Louisville researchers Henry Savitch and Ronald Vogel put it in one paper, the merger created "Suburbs Without a City."

ø•Will Wes Welker be back with the New England Patriots? It probably will come down to money. Welker's late drop in the Super Bowl was a costly, uncharacteristic mistake he said he would spend the offseason living with. Tom Brady said he loves Welker. But with Brady 0-2 in his last two Super Bowls and 6-6 in his last 12 postseason games with 17 interceptions, the Patriots sorely need an infusion of big-play receiver speed. How high will owner Robert Kraft be willing to go for Welker?

With Palm, HP got the intuitive WebOS software, which ran on several smartphones. In July, HP released a tablet called the TouchPad that also ran WebOS.

HP still hasn't said what it plans to do with WebOS.

Though Nik's plight is the spine, the film also explores the ways in which the blood feud shifts the entire family dynamics.

"To me, I want to see the players go out and play with some energy and play hard, clean football. That's really the goal of the day," he said. "We're not going to go out there and try to scheme each other on offense or defense. It's a players' day. The day is for our players to perform in front of their parents and friends and the alumni and everyone else who comes back for that great day. I want them to go out there and play with energy and compete."

With that in mind, said the attorney, it would make more sense for the agency that oversees the Parkway to keep toll collectors on board for two more years at a discounted rate, than go ahead with a plan to hire a private company for five years.
And as for the villainy department, we shouldn't expect Tiger Woods to be a model of marital fidelity just because he can play golf better than anyone else in the galaxy. Nor should we have expected the many members of baseball's steroid club to resist injecting themselves with illegal substances so they could make more money. After all, the Wall Street barons who nearly brought the country to its knees are drawing huge bonuses at what amounts to taxpayer expense, and Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire didn't have MBAs to fall back on.
Crammed into a closet-sized office at the West Side health center recently, Margie Garcia went down a list of a few dozen Lawndale patients who were seen at hospitals in recent days, calling each one to schedule office visits or confirm appointments.

Veterans contending with PTSD could face significant challenges lasting years to a lifetime.

That will change with time and circumstance, however. They are captured and tortured as Russian prisoners of war, then reunited after a time fighting under force for the Nazis at Normandy on D-Day. By now, with what they've been through, they are the best of friends, finally understanding and appreciating one another through shared experiences. They want to get home to Korea, but the Allies are invading -- Kang ratchets up the CGI-enhanced battle effects, including loads of ships heading for the shore and planes dropping bombs overhead.

We've been through this a lot with the Rams, listening to the predictable comments of the players after another coaching change. Every time, it's the same stuff, as the team kept shifting leaders, kept shuffling the deck, kept hiring and firing, kept searching for the man with the magic touch. Fisher is the first one since Dick Vermeil to show up with a résumé that had some head-coaching heft behind it. And that matters to this group of players, who are sick and tired of being sick and tired.

In campaign mode, Gingrich is the polar opposite of Mitt Romney. Reportedly a bit shy, Romney, nevertheless, dives in, shakes every hand, signs every autograph, banters with everyone and smiles, smiles, smiles. It may be rehearsed and straight from some “How to Succeed in Politics” primer, but he’s as good at it as any TV game show host.

Tequila (Jalisco): Its namesake is hugely familiar to U.S. visitors, but the modest town, in a green valley about 37 miles north of Guadalajara — not so much. More than 55 percent of tequila is produced within 21 miles of the town of Tequila. Local cuisine includes cakes, cookies, and entrées steeped in the stuff.

The occasional tremors that rattle the dishes reinforce the notion that most who live in the most vulnerable parts of San Francisco, such as the Marina, have made a conscious choice to do so. Maybe there's a self-selection of risk-takers in the Bay Area and that's why the region has produced so many high-tech innovators, entrepreneurs, cutting-edge researchers, political mavericks. Maybe the high risk of an earthquake keeps away the timid and attracts those whose greatest fear isn't dying but not living fully.
Today Higdon is the rare composer whose livelihood flows entirely from royalties and commissions, including a recent one from Santa Fe Opera and the Opera Company of Philadelphia to write an opera based on the novel "Cold Mountain."

In regards to elections, cutting down days saved the taxpayers money. In regards to redistricting, the Supreme court APPROVED the House districts much to the consternation of liberal groups like the teachers union and league of Women voters.

Fatmi goes perhaps one step too far with the show’s fourth component: compositions of circles made from coaxial cables. Although lovely, they feel a bit tangential.

But when Michelle and I made it to the wine section, we knew the game was up. Maybe Market Safeway was a fluorescent proto-brothel for the boys, but unless we wanted jobs there, the closest we were coming to getting a phone number and playing "hide the salami" was to read the 800 number off a Columbus Cured Meats package (deli aisle) and then lose the bag in the car.

Kevin Rogers of the Arizona Farm Bureau put it this way: "My industry and others need legal access to labor pools that are seasonal, short- and long-term. These pools will not be sourced from this country. This is an essential fact. You can tell me to pay more, to use convicts, to hire more students, and you can tell me technology will solve my problems. ... You can presume to tell me my business. ... It won't change the essential fact of a need for immigrant labor in Arizona and the rest of the country."

I compare students who apply and are lotteried-in to students who are lotteried-out, to see how they do over time. It's apples to apples. The kids who applied are exactly alike -- their families are equally motivated -- the only difference between them is that some won the lottery and are going to public charter schools and some didn't. Some of the charter schools in my study have been in business for nine or 10 years; some are more recent. It covers about 55,000 students. We compare standardized test scores on statewide exams, and some other factors -- graduating on time, truancy, attendance.

Save a weather emergency, Wimbledon schedules three matches per day on its two chief courts, Centre Court and Court 1. That leaves 10 matches for more intimate courts that have from less than 1,000 to no more than 4,000 seats. In 2008, that meant one could see stars such as Venus and Serena Williams battling on Court 2 (they later met in the final, with Venus winning in straight sets).

To qualify for a free exam and, if needed, follow-up care, you have to be age 50 to 64, low-income and either under- or uninsured. The program's goal is simple: reduce the rate of colorectal cancer, the No. 2 cancer killer in the U.S.

Unlike a previous version of the DISCLOSE Act that included restrictions on political activity by government contractors and corporations with foreign ownership, Van Hollen's is all about timely disclosure. It would require unions, corporations, super PACs and other organizations that spend $10,000 or more on a "campaign-related disbursement" to disclose their donors to the Federal Election Commission within 24 hours. (Super PACs currently disclose their donors, but on a leisurely schedule.)

Villaraigosa, who is termed out of the Los Angeles mayor's office next year and apparently has his sights set on the Governor's Office, supports some version of the "split roll."

According to the DEQ, the church allowed workers to repair a boiler and piping at the church, including removing asbestos-containing insulation, even though a full asbestos survey identifying the asbestos-containing material had been conducted at the church several years ago. Workers tore and broke the material, which releases asbestos fibers into the air, the DEQ says. Asbestos fibers are a respiratory hazard proven to cause lung cancer, mesothelioma and asbestosis. Asbestos is a danger to public health and a hazardous air contaminant for which there is no known safe level of exposure.

After seeing the museum and temple, my favorite thing to do is stroll the streets. Kyoto was spared the bombing of World War II, so it is still a city of tiny stores.

As is the case in many years, and like your roses, our roses are also putting on a lot of premature growth, but we choose to go with the flow and wait until the appropriate time, then prune once and be done with it.

One of the pitfalls of having so many characters west of the Narrow Sea is that there will be episodes where our young khaleesi Dany is absent or only seen briefly. She’s dispatched her bloodriders in three directions, and true to the show’s brutality, Rakharo has returned as a head in his saddlebag. His mate wails that he “won’t be able to join his ancestors in the Night Lands,” and things look bleaker than ever for Dany and her upstart band of dragon enthusiasts.

Kudos to Dan Rodricks for his recent column in The Sun ("In anger and pain, little sympathy for the 'deaths of others").

Israel, for example, could announce that it would be willing to return the entire Golan Heights — providing Israel's security and water concerns were taken into consideration — to a Syrian regime that was genuinely democratic, if that regime signed a peace treaty with Israel incorporating trade, tourism and diplomatic relations. (As former Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir once said, "I will know that there is a real peace with Syria when I can go shopping in Damascus.") To be sure, many Israelis, remembering Syrian forces firing down on the Galilee from the Golan Heights before the 1967 war, would be loathe to give up the Golan. Nonetheless, the security benefits to Israel of a Syria that has broken its ties with Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas would be well worth the return of the Golan.

The story follows Nekrotzar (appropriately imposing bass-baritone Eric Owens), who may or may not be death incarnate, through the fictional Breugelland. There he meets Piet, who he tries to engage as an assistant, but ends up with as a drinking buddy. We also see a pair of lovers whose duets were sung with fresh, shimmering sound but unintelligible diction by soprano Jennifer Black and mezzo-soprano Renée Tatum.

Cornilles said that if he had been in Congress this year, he would have parted ways with most House Republicans and voted against repealing the new federal health-care law.

Once a powerhouse couple in charismatic Christian circles, the Whites started the ministry that would become Without Walls in a South Tampa storefront. Its present sanctuary seats 4,000, Randy White said.

New Jersey laws on sick pay are crazy. In the private sector, sick pay protects us from losing income when we are ill. That has morphed into a cash entitlement in most New Jersey towns, thanks to the power of unions. A few years back, four retiring cops in Parsippany walked away with a combined $900,000.
"There's a great debate going on right now about the disease model versus the choice model or the environmental model of addiction," Lewis says. "It's quite heated and quite controversial. And if you take a brain perspective, you realize it's not either."

A less upscale aspect of Portland rears its head with Fred and Carrie playing gutter punks, whose spare change pleas go nowhere until they get a dog. Why stop there? They get a puppy. Then a goldfish. And an amoeba. They get a check for 2 million dollars and celebrate by starting a drum circle.

A $50 million, once-secret stealth warship built nearly 30 years ago for the U.S. Navy is now set to be auctioned off for scrap. The Sacramento Bee reports ( bit.ly/JSIVzU) that the auction for the 164-foot Sea Shadow will close Friday. The Sea Shadow was built by Lockheed Martin in 1985 in Redwood City as a way to test radar-cloaking technology at sea. Two years before the military deployed the F-117 Nighthawk, a stealth attack jet, and the Navy was interested to see if the technology could work in the ocean. The lessons learned from the vessel, which from the front looks like letter “A,” are used in modern warship design. Navy spokesman Christopher Johnson said a museum home for Sea Shadow was sought, but no one was interested.

Is the 4-inch maple apple bacon pie ($5.25) sweet or savory or both? I'm not sure, but it was interesting enough to include. The maple can't compete with the bacon and just gets lost, but that's OK. Snuggling against the perfectly diced bacon is a generous handful of thinly sliced apples, cooked just long enough to release the apple sweetness but not so long that the apples lose their integrity. The combination of sweet apples and salty bacon shouldn't work, but it does -- and you'll have the empty plate to prove it.

What does proportional cost mean? As an example let's use your PG&E bill. PG&E charges you a fee per 1,000 watt hours for electricity. If you're a large user of electricity then you get charged more. If there are four people using a lot of electricity for computers, televisions, kitchens stoves, etc., you pay more then if only one or two person lives in housing unit. Basically you're changed for what you actually use, i.e., proportional to what you are actually using. The word is proportional cost, not average charge based on what the city thinks lives in a housing unit. Notice that the wording says "any parcel"; that means even if there is just one household they're overcharging then they're violating the law. The city has more than 5,000 single-family parcels that they are overcharging, because there are less then 3.27 people living in them.

Many pieces of the Coburn-Burr plan received bipartisan support in proposals last year from two commissions on the national debt, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and even President Barack Obama.

The facts: This ad is so simple that it leaves out some key points. Households with two people will indeed not pay extra taxes if they have a taxable income of less than $250,000. But the threshold for higher taxes is $125,000 if you file as an individual.
The rationale for the mandate goes beyond the issue of personal responsibility. It's also an integral part of Congress' effort to stop insurers from excluding people with preexisting medical problems. That sort of cherry-picking leaves millions of Americans unable to find affordable coverage. To combat that, the law requires insurers to expand their risk pools, offering coverage to all applicants at prices based only on their age, locale, family status and tobacco use, not their medical records. But these requirements could have the perverse effect of inducing people to drop coverage whenever they're healthy, signing up for policies only when they know they need expensive treatment. Such "adverse risk selection," as economists call it, would result in insurers covering only the sickest people, sending premiums through the roof. To minimize that problem, Congress added a requirement that all adult Americans carry insurance at all times.
"We've tried for generations to get people to stop using emergency departments for non-emergency care," Wade said. "We've failed."
The main objective of CYO sports, according to the philosophy in the bylaws, is to help young Catholics "be more Christ-like in the way they live" by developing Christian values.

Then, in 1969, CUNY adopted the controversial open admissions policy that opened the university's doors much more widely to minority students. Under this policy, CUNY liberalized admissions and expanded remediation, which many students needed because they had been forced to attend underfunded, overcrowded public schools. Critics charged that CUNY went downhill. But the vast majority of the senior college students completed remediation within a year and then performed as well as the students who did not need remediation.

Ohio State has been lucky in its draw this year. The Buckeyes were not in a loaded bracket containing North Carolina and Kentucky, as they were last season when they were the overall No. 1 seed. Cincinnati mud-wrestled ACC Tournament champion Florida State out early. Fab Melo's academic suspension removed the shot-blocker from Syracuse that enabled the Buckeyes to score inside in the East Regional final. Against Gonzaga, Kevin Pangos' pure-looking 3-pointer to tie a third-round game vs. OSU rattled in and out in the last 88 seconds.

I remember the early days after my son was born. We kept him in a bassinet in our room. I could hardly believe my ears. The amount of noises such a small baby can make is astounding. All night, I listened to my little guy grunt, groan and even cry in his sleep. With each sound, I popped out of bed, eager to watch his little stomach rise up and down.
In perhaps an illustration of that psychology, several hundred business leaders at the forum were asked for their projections on their own companies' prospects.

Now Vitek cooks in a cart like a man possessed to re-create every smell he left behind in the old country, to the point of foraging for wild mushrooms. With his wife, Monica, ever present at the window, Tabor bolted onto the scene in 2005 behind hulking pork schnitzel sandwiches, the signature dish that everyone orders. They're fine, but they don't hint at what's extraordinary here: generous Czech cooking made from scratch in the morning, from fruit-filled dumplings to chicken paprika, all for a mere $3.50-$7.

There are rumors of romance between Robin and Maid Marian (Jennie Spector), who can fend for herself with a sword, thank you very much. In fact, some very authentic-looking swordplay choreographed by fight director Kendall Wells makes this a real action entertainment. The lavish film-score music composed by Rodolfo Ortega accompanies a Hollywood-style kiss or two between Robin and Marian, but then she is off to save the day, obtaining the dungeon keys and helping all the tax evaders to escape.
But the most obvious explanation? Look at the best-picture list. And even with the expanded roster of 10 nominees, not one had a single, sizable role for an African-American. How can black actors be nominated if they’re not being cast?

"Plot users can plant flowers or vegetables, any legal plant product," he said.
Still, the 2 percent property tax cap is causing problems. The city is able to gain exemptions to raise revenue for pensions and health care — which increased by $20 million — but it still is operating under a $518 million appropriations cap, forcing it to take money from other areas to fund worker benefits.
House Bill 3238 was referred to the Ways and Means Committee in late March.
Valerie speaks for Team Military and Lace. Heidi loves the fun and color; Georgina thought the pieces worked well together while still having individual identity. Michael says it's hard to do military and lace theme without it turning costume-y. Heidi swoons over the design by, as she says, "Caza-nova." His lacy top with sexy bare back and stunningly tailored white pants makes her want to be that girl, Heidi says. Michael loves the workmanship, and they also like Peach's design, a ruby-and-lace top paired with slim-fitting blue skirt. Peach! Getting some love! And Casanova!

If the Buckeyes play to their capabilities, they'll win. But after the first half at Wisconsin and the first half against Penn State last week, I have doubts as to whether Ohio State will do that today against a good team in a tough place to play. Could those bad starts motivate the Buckeyes to come out firing today? Sure. But a veteran team shouldn't have needed a kick from Jim Tressel at halftime last week either.

A: I do think that the nature of the way we are has allowed us to stick around as long as we have, because we have that sort of flexibility that's ever-evolving and changing in whatever way I'm guiding it. I have friends that have been in bands a long time — at least as long as us — and they're much more defined as an entity. But as a creation, we're a collective of people going out and making music on our own terms.

We don't scream socialism when we provide health services as part of the Indian Health Service. Nor do we take to the streets in protest when required to pay taxes for police protection, roads and airports, library books and fire protection . And when I'm required to show proof of insurance when registering my car, I don't hear many folks at the DMV muttering socialism under their breath. We all seem to understand that if we all have car insurance, our society will be better off. The same is true for health insurance.
The pilot program would offer scholarships for 40,000 low-income public school students in 13 targeted districts — including Newark, Jersey City and Lakewood — to attend private or parochial schools chosen by their families.

1. Quinn should be a weapon in the Spagnuolo system. Spags is a master at concocting a pass rush. He's among the best in the NFL in coming up with ways to hassle the QB. Spags needs to have a good supply of rushers. It's the life blood to his system. The more pass rushers he has, the more imposing his system will be. And Quinn -- according to every pre-draft report I've read -- is a potentially spectacular edge rusher. I haven't seen one credible draft expert 'diss Quinn's pass-rush skills. They have other concerns -- can he handle the point of attack on runs? -- but no one disputes his ability to get after the QB. Spags can have a lot of fun messing with offensive coordinators as he moves Quinn around, aiming him at the pocket. And you cannot assess this pick without putting it into the context of how Quinn will be utilized by Spagnuolo and defensive coordinator Ken Flajole. It isn't just that Quinn is a pass rusher; he is a pass rusher that is joining a team with a HC who maximizes the ability of a pass rusher.

"Wives," said Meeks. "The original band was older guys who had more settled lives and families. The wives didn't want their husbands out on the road for months on end. And the work was hard. One-nighter after one-nighter. Same set every night then back to the motel."

The Roberts brothers treasure their legacy. They proudly tell stories of their working-class roots, the sons of a postal worker and a teacher. "We weren't rich.

I looked at three different models: the Rebel T3i, the 60D and the 7D. All have 18-megapixel sensors. The primary differences among them are how quickly they can shoot photos and the range of shooting settings. I ended up choosing 60D, which was the middle model of the three, because it had a great range of shooting options. Plus, I didn't want to spend several hundred dollars more just to take one or two more pictures per second, which was the main difference between it and the 7D.

A fortnight isn't a whole lot of time to accomplish anything, especially something as ambitious as passing off an orphan as royalty, but it suits Nielsen's purposes and her young readership.

 Perfect rice: Use 1 cup water to 1 cup fresh Calrose rice; 1 1/4 cups water to 1 cup older rice. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, bring water and rice to boil; cover and reduce heat to low. Let simmer without stirring for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let rest 5 minutes. Then, fluff with fork. Calrose rice is naturally sticky and tends to cling together.

Brandon Roy was one of my favorite Blazers of all time. The guy had major game. He showed leadership ability as a young player that was uncharacteristic of most players in today's game. He was fun to watch. He was the nicest guy ever. He was great on and off the court, which you rarely see these days. We all know that injuries are a big part of the game. He should hold his head up high knowing that he was one of the best players ever in a Trail Blazers uniform.
It was Mesquite's turn to play like a veteran ballclub. Paced by the complete-game performance of its ace, Spencer Applebach, Mesquite won 4-1 at Camelback Ranch to continue its run in the Division I elimination bracket.
Ritacco said he and the others used middlemen, shell companies, fake consulting contracts and third-party payments to hide the bribes. To conceal the large sums of money, he filed false income tax returns from 2004 to 2006 and conspired with Gartland to evade federal taxes from 2002 to 2010.

The Judges now get back to the business of trying to win a PSAL title after getting off to a 5-2 start, good enough for third place.
No one would ever believe Danville's Santorini was once a pizza joint. The space has been painted in hues of crisp white and pristine Aegean blue, chandeliers and fabric-draped lamps light the space, and one wall is given over to a massive photo mural depicting the blue domes and white buildings of the Greek island. And you can hear the faint strains of bouzoukis and the rhythms of the sirtaki wafting through the dining room.

September is a crucial time for teachers, and, having retired after 37 years of teaching, I knew I would be feeling the pull of the classroom when autumn arrived. So I decided instead to spend my September days in one of America's most stunning settings, Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. I had followed the reintroduction of the gray wolf into the West from Canada since the mid-1990s, and I knew the program had been extremely successful. I was determined to see wolves in the wild, so I signed up for the Fall Wolf and Elk Discovery program.
Our nation's track record is indisputable: When the United States wants to lead, we make a national commitment and invest the necessary resources. Since World War II, few policies have enjoyed as much bipartisan support as research and development. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Manhattan Project created the nuclear power industry; Presidents Dwight Eisenhower's and John Kennedy's post-Sputnik programs sparked the information technology and aerospace revolution; and Reagan's investments in defense technology helped win the Cold War.

Perhaps Taylor was distracted by the men who now flitted through her life (including two more husbands, U.S. Sen. John Warner of Virginia and car dealer Larry Fortensky). Perhaps she liked the easy paychecks too much. But after “A Little Night Music” in 1977, her hard-won position as a serious film actress was pretty much abdicated.

You're either gay or there's something wrong with you because you've never been married, so you're not a good prospect, anyway." All these years I was a 30-something dating a 20-something, and people would ask why I would do that, and I'd say because I can. The stupid thing about that, all of a sudden you move outside of that age and you can't. It's a timing thing. Right place, right time.

After having six anchors put in my shoulder and months of rehab, it came time for softball season again. I was not yet able to throw; I even tried to switch to throw left-handed, but it didn't work. So I was the designated hitter for the season and cheerleader while my team was on defense. Our team ended up winning districts and going on to take the state championship. I was able to end the season with a .340 batting average and have the game-winning RBI squeeze bunt in the state championship game."

That is why Europe will have to decide whether to centralize itself politically as well. Europeans don't want that because they know (or at least feel) that it would be to the detriment of liberty and prosperity. There is, however, a real danger that the politicians will do it anyway—behind the backs of those who elected them. And this is what bothers me most. The recent dealings in EU headquarters in Brussels—literally behind closed doors—about the aid package for Greece demonstrated that there is no democracy there. The German-French tandem made the decision on behalf of the rest of the euro-zone countries, and I am afraid this will continue.

May 12, 2010: Portland police Officer Christopher Burley, 31, was shot during a traffic stop in the Lloyd District. Officers thought Keaton Otis, 25, seemed suspicious because he was wearing a hoodie on a warm day and driving a Toyota Corolla that didn't "fit" him. They stopped him for failing to signal when changing lanes and for not pulling over right away.

Three other officers shot Otis 23 times, killing him. Otis had struggled with mental illness and was off his medication, family members said.

As a dancer showcase, "Lost Dance" delivers some epiphanies, bringing out the sparkling elegance of Makino Hayashi, equally ebullient in the closing "Lambarena," and providing Javier Ubell, Michael Linsmeier and Lucas Threefoot with terrific syncopated pyrotechnics to perform. Marred by some distractingly busy hand movements, "Lost Dance" with its Tharpian mix of ballroom, classical and modern dance, is clearly a keeper.

(Public support for the transit union during its crippling, illegal 2005 Christmas strike suggests New Yorkers may be reluctant to speak out against labor concessions, even now. Fine -- so let them put their money where their mouths aren't.)

The book's 25 chapters work as impressionistic pieces, even as transcribed stand-up bits.

Among the most regularly offered are the global and regional passes offered year-round by airline groups such as Oneworld, Star Alliance and SkyTeam. These tend to be good for up to a year of travel and cover more of the globe than JetBlue's pass. But you may need to identify your destinations upfront before you leave, and although cheaper perhaps than booking individual flights, they're not cheap. Pricing is generally based on where you bought the pass, seat class, number of continents visited and miles flown. The one-world fares, for example, start at $3,499 for three continents (before taxes, fees and surcharges) for a pass bought in the United States (for the same pass, prices start at $3,000 if bought in Venezuela).

For most complete results, enter partial name of official or corporation. Some corporations give gifts directly to relatives of a leader, possibly to avoid triggering gift limits to the leader -- a last name search will generally show those gifts. Misspelling and spelling variations in the data, which are submitted by lobbyists under disclosure laws, are common. Some dates are approximate. If keenly interested in a particular gift, click "source" after getting your results to see if there are any footnotes related to the gift. Some corporations split the cost of gifts, but each report the full cost to the state. If you see multiple gifts of the same price and date but from different entities, it's likely that it's one gift from multiple sources.

The Blues never had Perron and Steen in the same lineup for any of the four games. Perron missed the first two games vs. LA; Steen missed the last two.

For good measure, the movie also includes some hambone Hallmark-style narration about destiny and luck and choosing the right path in life, along with a few sun-baked shots of dogs romping through the grass.

Brady: I know we have a commission form of government and that's how it operates. Some mayors have been stronger than others in setting unified city policy ahead of time and then making budgetary decisions. That's the type of mayor I'll be. While things are fragmented from an organizational perspective, it doesn't have to be from a priority perspective. So we will set citywide priorities, and arts will be part of that. And then we'll build budgets up based on priorities. I'm frankly tired of the bureau driven mentality that drives horse trading to protect bureau projects. We need to have more citywide vision and set of priorities.

First off, the whole point of the federal research program is to find a technology that is unobtrusive, making it a far cry from existing interlock systems -- which seem partially designed to humiliate those forced to install them because having a tube attached to one's ignition signals to everybody who gets in the car that the driver has a drinking problem. The two most promising technologies under study are tissue spectrometry, which would use a touchpad and lasers to detect alcohol in human tissue, and distant spectrometry, in which sensors installed throughout the cabin could sniff a driver's breath automatically every time he or she gets in the car (apparently, the sensors can be placed in such as way as to ensure it's the driver's breath they're sniffing, not passengers').

I want to make clear that, in reaching this conclusion, we did not rely on rumor, hearsay, or biased accounts provided by individuals with their own agenda. Unless we were able to confirm an allegation by two or more sources, we did not include the allegation in our Report.

I now prefer directing where someone leads me where he wishes me to go rather than pushing me, I think. I enjoy having that trust. I must have that freedom.”

"The 25 Best World War II Sites, Pacific Theater" by Chuck Thompson. (Greenline Historic Travel, $19.95). A great addition to the military travel bookshelf, this is one of the few guidebooks that gives war sites in the Pacific the kind of roundup that you can find in several European theater guides (including Greenline's own excellent companion volume). It has little on the Japan invasion sites, but is top-notch for Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Tokyo, Yokohama and lesser known sites like the kamikaze museum in Kyushu. A must have.

Though typical of the stations of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway, the main-line railroad that served Cass, the handsome depot from which Cass trains now depart is a replica built in 1975, after the 1923 building burned. The locomotive shops, built at the same time as the depot, burned in 1972 and have been replaced.

Batchelder would have cited Greeks, Romans and Founding Fathers to denounce, in every mood and tense, any Democratic bill like House Bill 153 -- a budget with more riders than a flophouse has fleas. But now, Mr. Riffe's shoe is on a Republican foot. If it doesn't pinch yet, it soon will.

(The aircraft-carrier amendment was defeated even though 27 representatives voted for it.)

Judd is a successful, famous actress who has talent and beauty (yes, still) and has used both to her advantage. Her appearance was objectively on the table when she got leading roles in movies, scored cosmetics campaigns and appeared on the covers of fashion magazines. When Judd or any other actor -- male or female -- strolls down a red carpet in thousands of dollars of borrowed clothes and jewels, they’ve been objectified into a powerful advertisement for the designers who bedeck them. For Judd to be outraged that the same public that is awed by her looks -- a currency for her -- will chortle about cracks in the glossy facade seems to indicate she doesn’t understand how the game she signed up for, and has prospered from, is played. Interestingly, there is a bit of fairness in this brutal game: Only the beautiful are picked on. The stars who seem to be given a pass are the ones who start out with a deficit -- no homely or truly overweight actress is ever trashed on the red carpet. And if they do choose an outfit that manages to make them look decent, they are fervently applauded by fashion critics.
